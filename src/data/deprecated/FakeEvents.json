As part of this curriculum, students partake in the BRADLAB project, founded by Jason Bradbury. Here they are tasked with researching and unpicking both technology and consumer interests to develop an innovative new technological product.\n\nAs the Home of Innovation, SamsungKX have provided the University of Lincoln a virtual platform for students of the BRADLAB project to give them an opportunity to remotely pitch their exciting new product designs via pre-recorded video content. Students will receive exclusive feedback from the Samsung product design team, alongside leading TV presenter, author and technology broadcaster, Jason Bradbury.   \n\nKeep your eyes peeled for when we announce the winner of the project in a few weeks’ time. \n\nSubmissions for the BRADLAB project can be seen following the below link.\n\n||{\"passions\":[\"sciencetechnology\"],\"eventtype\":[\"\"],\"externalbookinglink\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWWZWB6mQJs&list=PLYx8n4LgMtQopkQ2-xGwt_7hifbDIMbyS&index=1\",\"youtubeid\":\"\",\"instagramhashtag\":\"\",\"featured\":false,\"sponsor\":\"\"}","imageURL":"https://app.qudini.com/api/events/event/8430/image.png","bannerImageURL":"https://app.qudini.com/api/events/event/8430/banner-image.png","slotsAvailable":300,"seriesId":208,"locationName":"Centre Stage","durationUnit":"HOURS","hasPassed":false,"isWebinar":false},{"id":8438,"identifier":"EWXCMVHHLEI","title":"Nourishing mid-week cooking, simplified","startDate":"07/01/2020","startTime":"12:00 PM","startISO":"2020-07-01T12:00:00.000Z","maxReservations":200,"durationMinutes":60,"maxGroupSize":2,"shop":{"storeId":4375,"storeIdentifier":null,"merchantId":316,"merchantName":"Samsung UK","storeName":"Kings Cross","phoneNumber":"0330 726 0059","defaultCountryCode":"GB","address1":"Coal Drops Yard","address2":null,"address3":null,"address4":null,"country":"United Kingdom (Great Britain)","locality":"London","postcode":"N1C 4DQ","region":null,"latitude":51.536219,"longitude":-0.126495,"googlePlaceId":"ChIJXbS71BcbdkgRCxCAKCgSJ2E","timeZone":"Europe/London","distance":null,"openDays":[],"topicCount":null,"eventCount":null,"googleMapLink":"https://www.google.com/maps?q=51.536219,-0.126495,18z","commaFormattedAddress":"Coal Drops Yard, London, N1C 4DQ, United Kingdom (Great Britain)","commaFormattedLocalAddress":"Coal Drops Yard, London","googleMapMarkerLink":"https://www.google.com/maps?q=51.536219,-0.126495"},"topic":{"id":212,"title":"Standard Event","detail":null,"imageURL":null,"bannerImageURL":null},"description":"Perhaps you love it or maybe you try to do very little of it but whatever your skill or will in the kitchen, we all want what we eat to be delicious, healthy and easy.\nFood writer, Katy McClelland shares her tips to simplify mid-week cooking. \n\n1)\tBuilding Blocks \nWith quick mid-week cooking, the most important thing is knowing what flavours you like, then you can vary it with different produce. Use recipes as a guide then add, streamline or swap with what you have, like or can get. Balance carbs, fat, protein and greens, your body needs a bit of everything and will just crave what it’s deprived of. Apps are a good way to monitor this, try the <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/apps/samsung-health/\">Samsung Healthy app</a> – it breaks down the calories and nutrients in each meal, so you know exactly what you’re consuming.\nYou will possibly have heard of Samin Nosrat’s book ‘Salt, fat, acid, heat,’ that really sums up what you need flavour wise in cooking for taste and satiety. Fat gives richness, even just cooking with a bit of butter gives so much difference - (try browned butter – you won’t look back).  If not, a good olive oil, cheese, nut butter or tahini does the trick. You also need a salty element for that savoury satisfaction – step forward sea salt, olives, anchovies or even marmite. Balance that with a bit of acid – lemon juice, balsamic, capers or pickles for example. The heat could be chilli and spices, but these also add toasty, roasty cooking flavours to your dish. \nLet’s take it one step beyond and think about texture – a bit of crunch will make you feel more satisfied, and maybe even a pinch of sweetness if it goes, think dried fruit in a tagine. And there you go. \n\n2)\tEating seasonally  \nWhether it’s fresh produce, meat, grains or dairy - if it’s been able to grow or mature naturally with minimal chemical or mechanical intervention, it’s not only good for your bank balance and the environment, but it’s also better for your health.\nRather than battling with the seasons to maintain supply of the same fruit and veg we should be listening to mother nature and eating the natural assortment the seasons provide; from fibrous vegetables like cabbage and broccoli in winter to antioxidant rich tomatoes and berries in summer. It will taste better, fresher and be more nutritious. \nCutting food miles and supporting local producers will improve the quality, availability and diversity of produce in future too, and your body - or rather your gut loves and needs variety to keep those microbes happy (though that also includes the occasional indulgence to keep your microbiome on its toes!). \n\n3)\tStorage and waste \nThere are so many hacks to curb your food waste and save money, one part is knowing your produce and one-part is good storage. Here’s a few tips... \nWash leaves and herbs in ice cold water, dry with a salad spinner then store in sealed Tupperware. They’ll keep fresh and crisp for up to 10 days. \nTrim vegetables before storing so they last longer and often you can use the leaves – cut the tops off carrots (the finer ends make a great pesto), trim beetroot leaves (fry with garlic as a side) and try chopping and pickling the stalks. \nOn that note, save odds and ends of veg for pickling- cabbages are great or lighter veggies like cucumber and radish can take a 10-minute pickle if they’re looking too sad for a salad. \nVegetable trimmings are also great for stocks and boosting flavour in soups and sauces, bits of onions, leeks, stalks from herbs and all sorts. Keep them in the freezer until you have time to use them, same goes for meat, fish bones and prawn shells. \nUse or freeze sour milk or yoghurt to make soda bread or scones. \nYou can even keep orange peels and dry in a low oven to crumble into to granola or yoghurt. \n\nSnap and share your dishes with #SamsungKX. \nBy Katy McClelland. \nKaty is a freelance food stylist, recipe developer & food editor.

Try 2-3tsp of has el hanout spice blend or harissa paste (if you can’t get those, then 2tsp of roughly crushed cumin seeds is also good – add some warmth with around ½ tsp of cinnamon and/or cardamon pods, cayenne pepper or chilli if you like)\n150g brown basmati rice \n450ml veg or chicken stock (or water) \n300g beetroot, (roughly 2) - peel and grate while the onions are cooking (swap for carrots if you prefer)\nTo serve – use what you have...\nA drizzle of;\nTahini, Greek yoghurt, ricotta or feta, lemon juice, fresh pomegranate seeds, balsamic glaze/pomegranate or date molasses\nA sprinkle of; \nParsley, coriander, mint or dill, toasted nuts – pine nuts, pistachios, hazelnuts or almonds, a few raisins or dried cherries \n(if you make it curry based swap tahini for almond butter, lemon for lime and use a drizzle of tamarind)  \n1 Heat a wide heavy based pan over a high heat (roughly 20cm – size will affect cooking time and absorption) add the butter and oil, let it sizzle then add the onions and a pinch of salt. Stir fry for 1 min, reduce the heat to medium (you’ll need to go slightly below medium if cooking on gas rather than electric). Cook the onion for 8 mins, stirring now and again. It should be lightly golden and translucent. \n2 Add the ras el hanout (or harissa) and rice, mix well, and then fry for a minute more. Add the stock, mix well and bring to the boil - allow to boil for 2 mins then add the lid and reduce to a moderate simmer for 25 mins. Add the beetroot in a layer on top for the last 10 mins (work quickly so you keep in the heat).\n3 Mix and season to taste, add herbs, drizzles and toppings to taste. \nSnap and share your dishes with #SamsungKX. \nBy Katy McClelland. \nKaty is a freelance food stylist, recipe developer & food editor.
