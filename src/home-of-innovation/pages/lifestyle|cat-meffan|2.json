In the left hand alcove there are various small, dark green indoor plants and blue and pink yoga mats rolled up in a woven basket. In the right hand alcove there is a dark, wooden table with an exposed light bulb lamp on top. In front of the table is a white sofa and cream stripped sofa which faces the large windows on the opposite wall. In front of the fireplace, a young woman - Cat Meffan - wearing light purple yoga leggings and a stone coloured cropped vest top stands in a yoga tree pose facing the camera on top of a black yoga mat.",
