While the British Museum’s doors may currently be closed, you can still see its extensive collection online, and together we want to continue inspiring children and young people to build, experiment, invent and create.",
            "We’re inviting you to discover some of the world’s most amazing architecture through our hand-picked collection of the British Museum’s objects and use it as an inspiration for your very own design! Look closely at intricate decorative details, to study the buildings of ancient and modern civilisations and have fun using your preferred artistic tools to develop your digital creative skills.",
            "What you build and how you build it is totally up to you. Use your favourite digital drawing app, have a go on Minecraft, sketch ideas on paper, or build something using cardboard, building blocks or found materials. Then, why not bring your creations to life using your digital device to take photos and videos, create gifs or stop frame animations?",
            "Share your creations with us on social media using #MuseumsFromHome and tagging us @SamsungUK.",
