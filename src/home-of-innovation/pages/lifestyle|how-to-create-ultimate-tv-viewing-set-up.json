			"<strong>1. TV can be good for you, embrace it</strong>",
				"Watching TV can help decrease loneliness (if you feel bonded with the characters in the show you are watching), increase connectivity (as you have a shared community with other fans) and lessen the stress hormone, cortisol, levels. So, next time you feel guilty for watching that new series, check yourself!",
				"<strong>2. Cut out the scrolling time</strong>",
				"It can be frustrating to spend an evening on the sofa scrolling through endless lists of shows, feeling uninspired and undecided by what to watch next. People even fall out with friends or family over such debates. The <a href='https://www.samsung.com/uk/tvs/qled-tv/qn95b-65-inch-neo-qled-4k-smart-tv-qe65qn95batxxu/'> Neo QLED QN95B </a> features a <a href ='https://www.samsung.com/uk/support/tv-audio-video/what-can-you-do-with-the-new-smart-hub/'> Smart Hub </a> that guides users to their favorite content or helps them discover something new.",
				
				"<strong>3.  Get critical</strong>",
				"Some people love viewing TV passively as they find it soothing to zone out. Others want stimulation found through an educational show or documentary. Think about what themes are being brought up in the shows you love, strength or friendship. What do you think about those ideas? ",
				
			"<strong>4. Get your friends on board</strong>",
			"Have a weekly viewing night where you alternate who hosts and who supplies the snacks. Notice how the gap between viewings build anticipation. You can also use the <a href='https://www.samsung.com/uk/support/tv-audio-video/what-can-you-do-with-the-new-smart-hub/'>Smart Hub’s Watch Together</a> feature which allows users to video chat with friends and family while watching your favourite shows – great for bringing you closer together, even if you’re apart. ",
				
				"<strong>5. Create a theme to match</strong>",
				"Getting lost in a show provides escapism, a break from the stresses of day-to-day life. Why not take it one step further and set up your environment to transport you to wherever you are on screen? Turn off the lights, put your baseball caps on and switch on your torches for Stranger Things. For the ultimate cinematic experience, pair your Neo QLED TV with a <a href='https://www.samsung.com/uk/audio-devices/all-audio-devices/?q-series-soundbars+s-series-soundbars+available-to-order'> Q-Symphony Soundbar </a> and step inside the action.",

				"<strong>6. How to eliminate ‘post-show blues’</strong>",
			"Urban dictionary defines post-series blues as “the sadness felt after reading or watching a really long series or story. The bitter feeling when you know the journey is over, but you don’t want it to end”. Before you have a rebound fling with another series to manage the blues, journal about what moved or inspired you in the series and consider how you can bring an element of what you experienced while watching into your own life.",
				
				"<strong>7. Dive deep into character-analysis</strong>",
				"We can become consumed by characters in shows, giving us a useful insight into parts of ourselves we rarely explore. Maybe the character spoke their mind, which is something you have always wanted to do, or they went on adventures and had a great love. When you find someone on TV who gets under your skin, ask why, what they represent for you.",
				
				"<strong>8. Create a viewing schedule</strong>",
				"We tend to feel bad after a TV binge as we feel we should be doing something different or more productive. Instead, choose the occasions when you want to spend longer watching or when you are just going for one episode. Maybe you had a hard day, so tonight is the night you watch the whole of the new Peaky Blinders season. Then tomorrow, make sure you have a phone call with a friend lined up or dinner plans that start before you go onto your telly time. ",
				
				"<strong>9. Use TV to learn a language</strong>",
				"Research shows that watching TV in a foreign language increases language comprehension, pronunciation and grammar. So, try streaming that new show in a language you wish to learn, and be amazed by what you pick up.", 
				
				"<strong>10. Watch re-runs of your favourite show to boost productivity</strong>",
				"Ambient noise, such as the sounds you hear when you work from a coffee shop, have been shown to increase productivity for many of us. So, when you need to focus, put a great episode of your favourite show on in the background at a low volume, or play the show to listen through your <a href= 'https://www.samsung.com/uk/audio-sound/galaxy-buds/galaxy-buds-pro-violet-sm-r190nzvaeua/'> Galaxy Buds</a>, and notice your attention span increase.
