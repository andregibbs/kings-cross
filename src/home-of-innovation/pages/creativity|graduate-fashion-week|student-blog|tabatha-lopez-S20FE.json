Single take allows you to capture the best moments, and those of which you might miss if using any regular camera. The feature allows you to pan around your environment, and the camera will automatically capture the best photographs and videos. The photographs and videos are then displayed to you in 14 kinds of ways (10 photos and 4 videos), such as different filters on photographs, including black and white filter; as well as boomerangs and hyperlapse for videos."

With my phone I can stay in touch with my friends and family, keep up to date with news, music, fashion, with my TV I can watch things for educational or entertainment purposes etc. As technology is so heavily incorporated in my life, I also use it in a professional field. I use social media to promote my work which means I can reach to such a large audience of people. During this time, with us going through a pandemic technology has really kept a lot of people sane and updated with what is going on. A lot of people have been doing live-streams and video calls using different social media platforms which has been a real nice way keeping people connected."

You can use so technology for so many different things and that makes our lives a lot easier. For example, I can use technology to listen to music on the go, I can use it to navigate myself around and I can also use it to know what’s going on around the world. But this also does mean we are very dependent and reliant on using technology in our day to day lives which can be very time consuming and could make you a bit disassociated from real life.",

Having the ability to play around with the lenses, really does impact the outcome of my photographs. The ultra wide angle always gives a very dramatic feel to the image, and I just love it! They’ll never be a moment in which me and my friends have to squeeze into a photograph again!"

When taking photographs with friends during the evenings and nightime it’s always been an issue for us to get the perfect shot. Flash is often too bright, therefore this night feature works perfectly for my friends and I. The night feature will basically shoot several frames at once, adjusting itself in order to pull in light and processes them into one clear brighter image."
