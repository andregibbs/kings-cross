            "A successful workout regime, as you hopefully know by now, isn’t about the occasional heroic effort, but consistency: crushing yourself with an hour of burpees and squats once a fortnight just isn’t as effective as doing something much easier two or three times a week. The only problem? This means that there are going to be times you should work out when you don’t really want to: when it’s too cold, too hard, or you’re just too tired. The solution: have a handful of ready-made fixes on hand to get yourself ready to go, and fire them up when you need a jolt. Here’s how."

            "There’s a Catch-22 to training: the more you’re trying to tackle, the more intimidating it is. If you’re aiming to hit your muscles from half a dozen angles every workout – maybe with a bit of fat loss on the side – you’re probably committing to an hour or so of training, making it easy to cop out early or scrap the whole thing. Instead, do a quick warmup and then do the one or two moves you know will give you the biggest bang for your buck. A classic example? Do as many press-ups as you can, rest for two minutes, then do 50% of your max every minute, for five minutes. You’ll tax your muscles and lay the groundwork for improvement, without burning your willpower or sacrificing a huge chunk of your day."

            "A good warmup doesn’t just get your body warm and your heart pumping: it should also fire up your CNS (central nervous system) to let you recruit maximal muscle fibres for whatever you’re doing — so a handful of stretches and a couple of squats won’t cut it. Instead, skip for a minute – this’ll also help your coordination – then either do high knees on the spot for 10 seconds, or jump squats for the same amount of time. You’ll finish with a new spring in your step."

            "There are plenty of studies showing that music can help you put in more effort in a workout, but there’s increasing evidence that it can also aid focus and concentration – if you pick the right tunes. The theory is that we have two attention systems: a conscious one that enables us to direct our focus towards whatever we’re actually concentrating on and an unconscious one that shifts attention towards anything our senses pick up that might be significant. Music – preferably slightly syncopated<sup>[1]</sup> but not too manic – can help block out unnecessary sources of the latter, making noise-cancelling headphones an ideal way to stay focused. The <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/audio-sound/galaxy-buds/galaxy-buds-pro-silver-sm-r190nzsaeua/\">Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro</a> are great for this, they have Intelligent Active Noise Control<sup>[2]</sup> meaning you can switch from pure noise cancellation (which cuts out up to 99% of background noise) to Ambient Mode<sup>[3]</sup> , which allows you to amplify nearby sounds by 20 decibels. Perfect for whether you’re running outside or doing a quick workout at home."

            "Pre-workout supplements can work, but there’s a simpler way to get a boost before you train – coffee has proven workout-boosting benefits, and doesn’t come with any of the unwanted extras you might find in less proven powders. The key is when to take your shot. Studies suggest<sup>[4]</sup> that coffee starts to take effect around 10 minutes after you drink, but peaks in effectiveness 45 minutes after it enters your system – so if you down an espresso half an hour before you plan to train, you’ll be feeling the buzz just as your workout gets into high gear. Remember, though - caffeine can dehydrate you, so it’s worth chugging a glass of water alongside your brew."

            "Picture the scene: it’s raining outside, you’ve got a load of work to do, a new season of Brooklyn 99 just hit Netflix...and it’s a workout day. What you tell yourself next matters, according to several studies conducted by researchers investigating the effects of language on sticking to ‘goal directed’ behaviour. Say ‘I can’t miss this workout’ and you’re setting yourself up for a fall - you’re putting an external restriction on yourself and undermining your own agencies. Say ‘I don’t miss workouts’ and you’re making a decision - framing yourself as the sort of person who goes at it whatever the weather – so you’ll find it easier to train not just that day, but every day.",
            "It probably seems obvious that music can help you have a better workout – after all, that’s the whole point of Spin studios, and even marathons sometimes have brass bands – but there’s more to hitting a new PB than just cranking up the volume and searching Spotify for Workout Bangers. The science of using music to enhance performance is well-established – and even if you’re not aiming for Olympian heights of achievement, there’s plenty you can do to make your next gym session more productive by just changing your tunes. Here’s <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/explore/kings-cross/lifestyle/guest-writer-of-the-week/18/\">how to build the perfect workout playlist</a> – that takes you from hype-up to cooldown. And as mentioned, if you want to be fully immersed in your soundtrack, then get your hands on the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro – with an 11-millimeter woofer for deeper bass and a 6.5-millimeter tweeter for a crisp treble, the sound is unbeatable.",
