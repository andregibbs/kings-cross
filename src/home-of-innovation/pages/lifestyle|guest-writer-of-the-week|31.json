						"The heart of any home is the kitchen, because it’s where people converge over the most basic of interests: food. However, this is also the room that is often neglected when it comes to interior design. Journalist and former chef Almara Abgarian – who is currently renovating her own kitchen – is here to help with some simple but effective tips on how to give new life to this important space."

						"Start by creating a mood board, it will help ensure that the kitchen has a cohesive theme. Then, do your research. Interior terms can often seem scary but they’re actually very helpful. Not sure what your style is? Read product descriptions of existing products in your home to find out what you’re drawn to or have a scroll through Pinterest for inspiration. Then, ask yourself what you need from your kitchen. Is it intended as a social space for entertaining friends? How important is style versus practicality? Does it need to be family-friendly and child-proof? Don’t be afraid to experiment but make conscious choices."

						"Many people think it’s difficult or expensive to replace existing features in a kitchen, but nothing could be further from the truth. First up, tackle the cupboards; consider painting these in a new shade or add new handles to spruce up an otherwise ‘generic’ look. If you have nice crockery, consider removing the cupboards completely and replacing these with budget-friendly shelves to showcase the collection. Personally, I keep my wooden cutting boards on hooks next to my cupboard, partly because I like them on display, but I also use these a lot – and this provides easy access."

						"Don’t just accept whatever your home came with. After all, you open the fridge at least a few times per day, so why not make sure it’s pretty to look at, too? White is so last year. As an example, <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/refrigerators/bespoke-eu/\">Samsung’s Bespoke refrigerator</a> is fully customisable and comes in 20 different colours, including pastel shades and seven finishes, like the luxurious Champagne Rose Steel. You can even choose multiple colours for one fridge – like having sky blue top doors and a lavender freezer door, perhaps. It’s guaranteed to set your kitchen apart from the rest."

						"Once you’re happy with the ‘big stuff’, it’s time for details – and these are very cheap to add but make a big difference. Consider buying plants, paintings or freestanding features like a wine rack, a rustic shelf for dry goods or maybe just a fruit bowl. Pour oil into fancy bottles, replace ageing utensils and add an accent rug. You could change the backsplash too by adding peel-and-stick tiles in an unusual pattern or painting the grout from white to black. Small changes can transform a kitchen in minutes."

						"OK this rule isn’t entirely true… but the inside is very important.Consider this: you open the cupboard and find plates and glasses in disarray, nothing is where it should be and cooking no longer feels like fun, but like effort. Throw out goods that take up unnecessary space and buy containers for ingredients that you use often. Don’t keep non-perishable goods that you bought ages ago; if it’s not going to get eaten, donate it to a neighbour or a food bank. It may seem like a small thing but not seeing that old tin of tuna every time you reach for something else will bring you peace of mind, trust me. I like glass containers with cork lids for my coffee, pasta and rice – as it lets me see when I am running low. But it also looks stylish; I put these containers on my kitchen counter to act as a decoration on their own. The same goes for the fridge and freezer. For instance, add a rack for wine, beer, or even beauty products - the <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/refrigerators/bespoke-eu/\">Samsung Bespoke refrigerator</a> provides modular storage options for all of your needs. Food safety is also key. Label dishes and ingredients and keep raw meats in separate bags."

						"Make technology work for you. Add a speaker system (I highly recommend dancing in the kitchen while cooking), keep a phone charger on hand and invest in a decent kettle or espresso machine.You can also go high tech by adding features such as the <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/smartthings/\">Samsung SmartThings</a> Cooking, which lets you manage meal plans, store recipes and keep a fridge inventory. What’s more, it also connects to other Samsung appliances.",
						"Don’t forget the lighting but bear in mind: kitchen light needs to be both functional and atmospheric.If you have access to a lot of natural light, utilise it (avoid thick curtains or drapes). If you don’t, get under-cupboard lights or LED strips for working spaces. For communal areas such as islands or breakfast bars, go for a nice pendant or otherwise stylish lamp and try a variety of lumens (brightness) – i.e. warm versus cool light."
