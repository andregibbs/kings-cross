            "A utility room should look clean, be well-lit, and have a calm aura, and the colours you choose for its walls and units are key. The word ‘clean’ probably suggests white, but – just like in the bathroom – use too much of it and the effect can be clinical rather than stylish. ",
            "Instead, consider using white just for the walls, or limiting it to the units. This way, you’ll still enjoy the brightness of light-reflective surfaces and create a pristine feel, but you can introduce a second colour to bring more personality to the utility room. ",
            "Darker shades like deep blues, blacks, or greys are on trend for kitchen cabinetry, so you could repaint units in one of these tones. If the utility room is located just off the kitchen, you might want to match to the units there for a cohesive feel.",
            "Don’t want such a strong contrast? Tonal neutrals for both walls and cabinets can keep the room light filled and create understated contemporary style.",

            "A utility room definitely doesn’t have to be a pattern-free zone just because it’s a hard-working space. Where to introduce it when there are units and appliances all round the walls? The floor provides the perfect opportunity to bring interest to the space using patterned tiles or vinyl.",
            "Both will work in an area where splashes are inevitable, and are easy to clean. Tiles are a classic hard-wearing choice, while luxury vinyl can offer warmth underfoot and be more forgiving of dropped objects.",
            "When it comes to which pattern to opt for, geometrics are a great fit, suiting both older and new homes, and they’re an on-trend choice designers and influencers show no sign of renouncing.",

            "Your utility room is likely a space for washing, drying, and ironing, and even minor clothes repairs could take place there. The kit you need for all these tasks needs to be at hand, but this necessity can actually gain you style points. Instead of shutting everything away, use wall space for attractive shelving that leaves everything ready to grab, plus adds to the room’s élan. ",
            "Think it’s going to look messy? The key is to choose containers that will corral essentials whether they’re for cleaning, sewing or other household jobs, and which look good on show. There are some fabulous purpose-made designs around, but you can think laterally, too. A jug or vase could accommodate some cleaning must-haves, for example. Think materials as well. Woven baskets will add a natural note, metal has a traditional vibe, while wood and earthenware are tactile.",
