Samsung encouraged arts students and creators from the UK & Ireland to film and submit audition-style performances to Instagram using #SamsungSpotlight, to shine a spotlight on those who had lost their stage due to COVID-19.",

                    "For his entry, ‘Mime’, Michael spent two days in his room writing, making noises in a microphone, and performing in front of a mirror. Michael said that his experience with Samsung Spotlight has added to the sense of community, encouragement and support that is vital for the arts during the pandemic."

He travelled to Dublin with a desire to study and explore a new city however, like many others in higher education, his lessons have moved online which he feels has distanced him from his goals. Despite this, he’s grateful to his teachers at The Lir who have been persistent in their support throughout the pandemic.",
                    "Despite these restrictions, Adrian believes that his involvement in the initiative is demonstrative of how people in the arts are still creating, performing and adapting to new challenges. His entry ‘RESTRICTED’ draws on his desire to explore Dublin as he shared some of the locations he’s discovered during his time in the city. Adrian has said that the Samsung Spotlight initiative has reminded him that life doesn’t happen in front of a computer screen; it happens beyond the walls of our rooms."
