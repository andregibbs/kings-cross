						"Ever wondered why it feels so nice to take deep breaths in a forest or the woods? That’s our foliage friends helping us out by providing cleaner air. And you can create the same vibe (on an albeit smaller scale) by choosing plants that remove airborne toxins in your home. Good options here include evergreen plants such as English Ivy and Boston Fern, both of which are known to soak up chemicals such as formaldehyde and benzene from the air. Another air purifying houseplant hero is the Peace Lily. Not only does it have gorgeous white flowers so that it’ll look magnificent in your space, but it’ll also improve the air quality in your home by actively absorbing harmful chemicals through its leaves.

						"Want to sleep better? Then pop a striking Snake plant or Aloe Vera into your shopping trolley next time you’re at the garden centre. These are also great at removing toxins from the air – so good in fact that Aloe is even Nasa-approved! But, the real magic with these plants is that because they go through photosynthesis later in the day, they produce oxygen at night. This in turn means a better night’s sleep for you when you keep them in your bedroom."

						"If your bathroom has low or no natural light, then keeping a plant in there could prove too tricky. However, one option is to tie a bunch of Eucalyptus with some string and wrap that around your showerhead. Not only will it add some green to your space, but each time you have a shower, the steam will interact with the leaves to release essential oils and fill your bathroom with a deeply calming fragrance. Simply replace every few weeks. "

						"Want the green look, but don’t want the extra hassle of keeping a temperamental plant alive on your to-do list? Don’t worry, there are failsafe options out there for you too. For instance, both the Chinese Money Plant and Snake Plant are incredibly easy to look after – coping with most light conditions and lax watering schedules. The Dragon Tree is also another low fuss option to care for – surviving in low light. However, as there are a few varieties of Dragon Trees, make sure you’re picking up the right plant by popping to the flower market in person if possible. The Galaxy Z Flip3 is great for when carrying new plants home, as it can fold in half and fit into the skinniest of jeans or smallest of pockets."
