						"Playing video games benefits your mental health – that’s a fact<sup>[1]</sup>. In 2021, more studies support the use of gaming as a therapeutic tool than ever before, and some prove it’s on par with more traditional hobbies and pastimes like binging your favourite shows or losing yourself in a good book. People that play games – particularly people that play games collaboratively – typically report greater mental wellbeing than those that don’t.",
						"Gaming, like any hobby, gets better and more effective as a tool for relaxation as you commit more time and resources to it. Games have the power to transport you unlike anything else – thanks to the mentally active, engaging nature of gaming, video games tend to bring you into the world as a more active agent, not as a passive observer. As such, it’s not just easy to lose hours in a given fantasy world… it’s almost essential if you want to enjoy a brief, virtual holiday from the stresses and anxieties of the real world.",

						"Escapism is a psychological phenomenon that happens when your brain goes into a different state, and it can be good for you<sup>[2]</sup>. During 2020, when the world was learning to socialise at a distance thanks to the lockdowns, video games became a respected and essential tool for anyone eager to resume a somewhat normal life. Even the World Health Organisation encouraged people to engage with more video game content<sup>[3]</sup> in order to help offset the effects of isolation and loneliness during the worst of the lockdown. The power of immersion is recognised by medical experts the world over then, and games that help immerse the player – you – are demonstrably good for your health."

						"Depending on the sort of player you are, you’re going to respond to different games differently – everyone is different when it comes to video game immersion, after all. Some players are liable to suspend disbelief and engage with another world if the graphics are more photorealistic, say. Other players may become more immersed in a game world that features characters that are more like them in personality or appearance. It depends on a players’ personal preference in games when it comes down to what works better for the individual player. Whether you can sink hours into the cutesy, easy-going island life simulator of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, or prefer the pseudo-realistic mechanics and world of Red Dead Redemption 2, there’s a game out there that has the potential to ease you through hundreds of hours of calm, focused gaming time if you let it.",

						"There are many factors that influence immersion when it comes to videogames – rewards, gameplay loops, difficulty, flow – but one of the most powerful tools for helping gamers lose themselves in a virtual world is graphical fidelity. Tech is catching up with gamers’ desires to lose themselves fully in virtual worlds: virtual reality is the most notable aspect of this, and doctors around the globe are already in the process of using VR headsets for therapeutic and medical reasons<sup>[4]</sup>."

						"If you don’t have the space to invest in a full-scale VR setup in order to transport you to your virtual world of choice, you could opt instead for a more immersive monitor than the standard one you likely perform your day-to-day tasks on. <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/monitors/gaming/dqhd-monitor-with-1000r-curved-display-49-inch-lc49g95tssuxen/\">The Samsung G9 monitor</a>, for instance, has been specifically designed to match the contours of the human eye to better engage players that are sitting at their battlestations for extended periods of time, making for better comfort and heightened realism. QLED, HDR1000, and DQHD resolution also combine to create a visual profile that’s just as realistic and immersive as a VR headset – yet without the excessive cables, price and setup."

						"Long gone are the days where the general consensus was that gaming is a negative thing, where it was assumed that people that spend time playing video games are maladjusted or unwell. Current data suggests that just 0.3% of gamers might experience problems controlling the time they spend playing video games<sup>[5]</sup> – and it’s largely thanks to better tech and utilities in the gaming industry that players are experiencing better health. Even something as seemingly minor as the HDR1000 and HDR10+ brightness capabilities of the <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/monitors/gaming/dqhd-monitor-with-1000r-curved-display-49-inch-lc49g95tssuxen/\">Samsung G9 monitor</a> can help prevent eye strain during longer play sessions, proving that tech is quickly catching up with the needs and habits of the modern gamer.",
						"Now, people from all walks of life are experimenting with gaming as an outlet for the stresses they deal with ‘IRL’, and gaming time has become as common as going to the movies or playing sports as a way of relaxing or chilling out with friends. If you’re going to spend more time escaping into virtual worlds, you owe it to yourself to use the best tools possible to make your rejuvenation time as enjoyable and engaging as possible.",
