            "A living space that features a dramatic shade will look as good in real life as it does on your Instagram feed. Consider colours like warm orange-red, deep blue or green, or even charcoal. They can all create a backdrop which furniture, lighting and decorative accessories can contrast against to give a fabulous effect.",
            "Worried the room might be too dark? Don’t be! The result can be cosy and cocooning – just what you want from a living room. However, if you prefer, you don’t have to use a dramatic shade all around the room. Try it for the wall behind the sofa, or for even smaller areas such as the rear of shelves for a pop of colour. Shots of both of these could go down a storm on your Insta feed, too."

            "Contrast is key for a living room scheme that’s full of interest, and that doesn’t just mean colour. Think textures as well for a room rich in decorative detail. You might like to set a deep pile rug in front of a smooth velvet sofa or armchair, or you could dress existing seating with woollen, knitted, faux fur or woven throws, or with a selection of cushions in tactile finishes. You could add in a rattan chair or, for a lower budget way to add texture, go for wicker storage baskets.",
            "Different textural finishes make a room pleasing to your eye and sense of touch every day, plus they look great on camera. Rugs for sinking your feet into, interesting knits, strokable fabrics and woven materials along with smooth pieces create plenty to draw the eye to your Insta image."

            "For a great living room scheme, consider the smaller elements you’ll take pleasure from when you’re in the space – and that you’ll want to share as vignettes. It might be chic storage furniture, smart shelving, lush houseplants or weird and wonderful succulents, or a special piece for your entertaining space like a luxe drinks station.",
            "Don’t leave it there, though. Arrange decorative accessories to make a stylish grouping on the top of a sideboard or console table, or create a gallery display with artwork hung directly above it. Arrange books by colour or size to grab attention and take a brilliant #shelfie, or show off gorgeous glasses, decanters and a cocktail shaker along with elegant bottles at your drinks station."

            "With the annual festivities around the corner now, you’ll want to bring Christmas to your living room and share the loveliness on social. Dress up the mantelpiece if you’re lucky enough to have one, or create a display on a side table. A simple grouping of candles of different heights along with seasonal foliage can create atmospheric illumination and makes a great vignette for your feed. ",
            "A sizeable Christmas tree is a must-have if your room has the dimensions, and choosing a single bauble colour or a limited range of shades makes for both impact in the room and on a screen. When you’re shooting, avoid putting the tree dead centre of the photo. Instead, use the rule of thirds: in other words, if you imagine your image divided into three equal parts vertically, your tree will be along one of these lines with other elements of the room scheme shown in the rest of the photo.",
            "To win double taps and followers you’ll also need to make sure your phone can deliver whether you’re planning to post #homeinspo at Christmas or throughout the rest of the year. The <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/smartphones/galaxy-s20/galaxy-s20-fe/\">Samsung Galaxy S20FE</a> has a triple lens camera, so you can easily pick from wide angle and ultra wide to shoot your room, plus capture the details with the 3x optical zoom on the telephoto camera. With a range of stylish hues to pick from, your phone can complement your room’s colour scheme perfectly, too.",
