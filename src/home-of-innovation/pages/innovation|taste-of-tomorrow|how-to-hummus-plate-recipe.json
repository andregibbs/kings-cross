            "Hummus is for more than carrot sticks – it can form the base of this super satisfying, endlessly variable meal. Making your own hummus is really easy if you own a food processor or blender. I like making mine thick and creamy by adding extra tahini, and leaving out the oil. Vinegar is a more sustainable option to lemons in this recipe. If you can, bulk - cook your own chickpeas – it’s easier than you think and tastes SO much better! Once cooked, they can be frozen in smaller portions so you always have some on hand. The hummus keeps for up to 5 days in the fridge."
