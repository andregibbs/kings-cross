The four-day event is held annually on the first weekend in June by the charity the graduate Fashion Foundation featuring work from 38 UK Universities and 40 International universities across all Fashion disciplines from Design and Styling to Photography and Marketing.  The platform has launched some of the biggest names in fashion and its patrons and ambassadors include Vivienne Westwood, Nadja Swarovski, Victoria Beckham, Christopher Raeburn, Henry Holland and Diane Von Furstenberg to name but a few.",
            "For students, Graduate Fashion Week is the pinnacle of their academic life that they all work tirelessly towards to be showcased in front of the industry and maybe win one of the prestigious awards that celebrate the students work.  With many of their University Fashion Shows also cancelled the 2020 year group have been left bitterly disappointed and unsure of how their degrees will conclude.  Therefore, finding an alternative platform to showcase the incredible talent of tomorrow has been critical.",
