            "The texture of this mousse is incredible – it’s hard to believe it’s completely vegan. The miso adds a little extra depth of flavour, but a pinch of sea salt is delicious too. It’s so easy to make it almost feels like cheating and it’s become one of my most made desserts. The hardest part is to allow it to set in the fridge, but do wait – it’s so worth it! Keeps for up to 5 days in the fridge."
