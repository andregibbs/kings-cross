            "Samsung has partnered with leading wellness enthusiast, Cat Meffan, to enhance the UK’s wellbeing movement by offering the ultimate virtual yoga experience.",
            "New research commissioned by Samsung has revealed Brits are upping the ante on their health and fitness routine, with over a third now focussing more on their wellbeing and 29% having a new interest in mindful activities to distract from the outside world. What’s more, yoga has been revealed as one of the top three hobbies being tried for the first in recent weeks.",
            "As a result, Cat teaches ‘Yoga for Beginners’, the first in a series of three sessions guided by Samsung’s ecosystem of products. In this session, Cat focuses on the Galaxy Watch Active2 and the new Samsung S20 Ultra, whilst also showcasing how to track fitness and wellbeing goals with Samsung Health."

To really get into a groove, find a playlist that syncs to the rhythm of your fitness activity. Some music streaming apps have BPM (beats-per-minute) playlists you can access on wearables like the <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/wearables/galaxy-watch-active2-r830/SM-R830NZDABTU/\">Galaxy Watch Active2</a>, where the BPM of these songs also matches your target heart rate. Simply download and go!"
