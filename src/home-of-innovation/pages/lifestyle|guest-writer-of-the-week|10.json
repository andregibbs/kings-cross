Between new types of always-online experiences, to full-blown remakes of classic games, as well as the latest and greatest in graphics and game design, this generation has had it all.",

Its bright colours and easy-to-learn but difficult-to-master building mechanics make it the complete antithesis of every other \"Battle Royale\" game out there, and it's become a place where friends get together to squad up, find secrets, and compete with other players. No game since Minecraft has become such a pop-culture phenomenon, and it's unlikely anything will, again. In fact, you can download it to your smartphone right now and see what the fuss is about!",

Its stealth is more refined, combat is more brutal, and the game's mutated monsters are scarier than ever. Unmissable.",
