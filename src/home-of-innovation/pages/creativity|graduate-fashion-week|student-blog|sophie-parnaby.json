I then spent a further six months working for Julien Macdonald, a luxury label with a focus on embroidered gowns, which is where my interest in embellishment grew. Throughout university I had always been interested in sustainable fashion, and in final year we were set a sustainable design brief which was a great opportunity merge these two interests.",

I’ve seen how 3D printing is increasingly becoming a more sustainable way to manufacture in other industries, and I think it’s so important that this ground-breaking technology is applied in the same way within the fashion industry.",

I considered how new species would evolve in this altered climate, investigating the idea of biomimicry and hybrids. One piece that I called ‘Icarus’ is completely covered with 3D printed textures, which formed wing like structures that appear to be an extension of the body. It's been great to showcase my collection at the hub of innovation, Samsung KX during Graduate Fashion Week!",
