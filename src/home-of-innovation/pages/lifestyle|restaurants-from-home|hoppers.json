						"<em style=\"font-style: italic;\">Welcome to Restaurants from Home with Samsung KX</em>. Samsung KX, the Hub of Innovation, has partnered with a line-up of King’s Cross’ most loved restaurants to inspire you to get creative in the kitchen. Each episode will include step-by-step instructions to recreate menu favourites from the comfort of home.",
						"We’ve partnered with award-winning restaurant Hoppers - a Sri Lankan and South Indian restaurant in King’s Cross - to exclusively bring you the recipe of their bestselling ‘Banana Leaf Bream’. Boasting a showstopping, spicy fish supper, it guarantees to get taste buds tingling. Hoppers’ Director, Karen Gokani, rustles this up from the Samsung KX Connected Kitchen, where he uses the <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/cooking-appliances/ovens/electric-oven-nv75n5641rs-eu/\">Samsung Dual Flex Oven ™</a> and <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/apps/smartthings/\">SmartThings app</a> to help him cook up a storm, and snaps his final dish in Food Mode using <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/smartphones/galaxy-s21-5g/buy/?modelCode=SM-G996BZVGEUA&cid=UK_PPC_6388038105_FF~Eval:Brand%2BProd_ProjectU_Tease_KS~BAP_BS~IM_PR~SMART_SB~GS21_OB~SALES_PK~ROAS_FS~LHQ_MD~W_AI~N_MT~EXA_CA~KEW&gclid=Cj0KCQiA0-6ABhDMARIsAFVdQv_3ttr51rnQx-wVOZfkUXxij1yz4iMiQiARbsCRScjihnmG-7qMICgaAurXEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds\">Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G</a>."

						"1 tbsp coconut oil, or any neutral oil",

						"Make a paste of 1 tsp salt, the turmeric powder and lime juice. Rub all over the fillets and leave to rest for 15 mins.",
						"Toast the cumin and fennel seeds in a dry pan for a couple of minutes and once cool blitz with all the remaining ingredients (except the fish!) in a food processor or smoothie maker to make a course paste, using a splash of water if required. Taste the paste to check for seasoning, add some more sea salt if required. Keep the paste fairly thick so it coats the fish well.",
						"Run the banana leaf over a hot pan or submerge in boiling water for a few seconds. This makes the leaf flexible and prevents it from ripping when you wrap the fish. Put a generous amount of herb paste over each fillet and wrap individually in the banana leaf, followed by a layer of tinfoil on the outside. Scrunch together the edges of the foil to make a tent, leaving enough space for the fish to steam, do not wrap the fish too tightly.",
						"Place the parcels on a baking-sheet and cook in an oven preheated to 160°C for 18-20 minutes or 12-14 minutes if using individual fillets.",
						"Serve the parcels as they are so the delicious aromas waft out when they are opened on the table."
