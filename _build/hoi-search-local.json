Get to know your tablet, what apps work for you, and practice your pen control!","If, like me, you are new to digital drawing, then the Galaxy Tab S7+ is a great device to learn and practice, with the S Pen tool that glides over the surface and a diverse range of apps to choose from. As a beginner, you may want to start with the in built ‘Pen Up’ app, where you can familiarise yourself with drawing on a screen and the quick selection tools for colours and pens. If you are used to drawing on paper it could feel a little odd at first, but you’ll quickly fall in love with the sleek ergonomics.  For a more advanced drawing, you may want to download something from the Google Play store, such as Adobe Photoshop Sketch. You may also want to explore which format you hold your tablet in. My preference is always portrait as I draw elongated models.","","2. Experiment!","To really get to know the capabilities of your tablet, you should have fun experimenting with the different pen tools available and the variables within them. My visual identity is made up of quick, energetic mark making and lots of vibrant colour, which can be achieved wonderfully on the tablet. I prefer using the Acrylic Brush and the Marker Brush tools, as they reflect real strokes of felt tip pens. I enjoy how responsive the pen tool is and the smooth feel as you glide on the screen. It also has this cool hover marker so you can accurately target your pen on the page, great for adding detail. As a fashion illustrator, the portability of having a tablet and digital pencil case is super convenient when documenting live shows.","","3. Sketch Layers!","For a 2D drawing you can really add depth and dimension using layers. This could be achieved by importing images from your device or creating new sketch layers. As a fashion illustrator, this is great for me as I can scan or photograph images to collage with using the tablet or use an existing template. Using separate layers, you can adjust the opacity and/or copy and paste layers to resize. This is something you cannot do with pen and paper therefore it allows for a more effective working process.","","4. Record, document and demonstrate!","From the drop-down menu on the tablet, you can easily and quickly access the screen record function. This allows you to record the process of your drawing. It is a great way to review your own techniques alongside demonstrating your unique process to others. I personally draw and work quite quickly, so this is a great function that allows me to clearly document how I work and the tools I use to others in a way that they can stop, pause and re-watch. It also makes great social media content!","","5. Play! ","What I love most about working on the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+ is the freedom to play. It can be quite daunting having to sketch directly on to paper, yet with the tablet there is the safety of knowing you can easily take a step backwards, create a new layer or even a fresh document. In the current climate, we can feel trapped and even bored, yet the ability to draw and play freely on the tablet is something I’m really enjoying.","","My illustration techniques to draw fabric textures…","1.

As a recent fashion design graduate, it was so amazing to see how technology had been integrated with fashion to showcase the work from the class of 2020. I’ve always been interested in using technology to enhance the way I design and make fashion collections. Since I’ve graduated, I’m now working on my own fashion line, using 3D printers to create innovative and sustainable fashion products.","Following the launch of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+, I trialled the new tablet using the Pen Up sketching app to design an accessory for my new collection. The S pen which comes with the tablet makes digital sketching so easy - I was amazed by the sensitivity of the pen, and I was able to build up construction lines with the different brush features, and by altering the colours and opacity. It’s unbelievably efficient for design applications, you can import reference images into the background, and the S Pen even has a discreet button on the side which seamlessly turns it into an eraser tool. ","The technical illustrations I created using Pen Up turned out really clear and detailed which is exactly what is needed from a design sketch. It’s a great tool which can be used to communicate and visualise ideas. Looking forward, I can’t wait to launch my collection and I’ll be using digital illustration to facilitate the design process.","","","","Articles"],"meta":{"icon":"article","tags":[]}},{"id":"creativity|graduate-fashion-week|student-blog|sophie-parnaby","title":"Speaking future fashion scenarios with Sophie Parnaby","description":"","image":"https://images.samsung.com/is/image/samsung/assets/uk/explore/kings-cross/home-of-innovation/creativity/graduate-fashion-week/sophie-parnaby/thumbnail.jpg","category":"creativity","url":"/uk/explore/kings-cross/creativity/graduate-fashion-week/student-blog/sophie-parnaby","values":["Speaking future fashion scenarios with Sophie Parnaby","","","","Speaking future fashion scenarios with Sophie Parnaby","Who you are and where do you study?","I’m Sophie Parnaby and I’m from Ilkley near Leeds. I’ve recently graduated from Manchester Metropolitan University with a degree in Fashion design and technology for womenswear.","","Describe your journey in fashion...","Halfway through my degree I completed a placement year, where I spent three months interning in the design department at Old Navy. I then spent a further six months working for Julien Macdonald, a luxury label with a focus on embroidered gowns, which is where my interest in embellishment grew. Throughout university I had always been interested in sustainable fashion, and in final year we were set a sustainable design brief which was a great opportunity merge these two interests.","","","How tech has been embedded in your design journey?","I’ve used 3D print technology to find a more sustainable way of creating embellishment and spent the majority of my final year at Manchester developing a process using a 3D printer to replicate the appearance of sequins. I’ve seen how 3D printing is increasingly becoming a more sustainable way to manufacture in other industries, and I think it’s so important that this ground-breaking technology is applied in the same way within the fashion industry.","","What inspired your designs and collection?","I called my final collection ‘Future Mythologies’ which explores a future scenario, fast forwarding to a time where the planet could be affected by climate change which would create new atmospheric conditions.

I love it as I can also follow my favourite artists and brands. I also use it as a way to promote my art.","Do you think technology has had a positive impact on our lives and why?","Technology definitely has had a positive impact on our lives as it enables us to stay in contact with friends and family. It’s also a way of discovering new people and new interests. There is always something new to learn. However, a daily break from our phones can be good for the mind.","The feature I liked the most on the Samsung S20 FE was the ‘single take’ on the camera. Single take allows you to capture the best moments, and those of which you might miss if using any regular camera. The feature allows you to pan around your environment, and the camera will automatically capture the best photographs and videos. The photographs and videos are then displayed to you in 14 kinds of ways (10 photos and 4 videos), such as different filters on photographs, including black and white filter; as well as boomerangs and hyperlapse for videos.","","","Mubiyna Campbell","How has technology impacted your daily life?","Technology plays a huge part in my life both social and professionally. With my phone I can stay in touch with my friends and family, keep up to date with news, music, fashion, with my TV I can watch things for educational or entertainment purposes etc. As technology is so heavily incorporated in my life, I also use it in a professional field. I use social media to promote my work which means I can reach to such a large audience of people. During this time, with us going through a pandemic technology has really kept a lot of people sane and updated with what is going on. A lot of people have been doing live-streams and video calls using different social media platforms which has been a real nice way keeping people connected.","Do you think technology has had a positive impact on our lives and why?","Technology has had both a positive and negative impact on our lives. The good thing about technology it really does allow us to stay connected. You can use so technology for so many different things and that makes our lives a lot easier. For example, I can use technology to listen to music on the go, I can use it to navigate myself around and I can also use it to know what’s going on around the world. But this also does mean we are very dependent and reliant on using technology in our day to day lives which can be very time consuming and could make you a bit disassociated from real life.","I really liked the fact that the Samsung S20 FE is in built with 3 different optical lenses, such as ultra wide camera, the wide-angle camera and the telephoto camera. Having the ability to play around with the lenses, really does impact the outcome of my photographs. The ultra wide angle always gives a very dramatic feel to the image, and I just love it! They’ll never be a moment in which me and my friends have to squeeze into a photograph again!","","","","Jade Ashley","How has technology impacted your daily life?","Technology helps me in daily life because it helps me contact all my friends and family. I have family in different countries so technology makes it easier for me to send pictures and messages to keep them updated with what’s going on. It also helps to me express myself on social media and show people what I’m passionate about.","Technology, has also served me in order to build my career as a DJ. Having a phone with me at all times, means I am able to promote my music whenever and wherever I want. It has served me to reach greater audiences and I definietly think it has had an impact upon getting bookings in the industry.","Do you think technology has had a positive impact on our lives and why?","I do think technology has had a positive impact as it has allowed people to expand and make new friends through social media etc. It has also made people’s jobs easier and simple; research and answers can be found quicker which can help a lot of people with both work and studies. Technology has allowed the music industry to expand and introduce new types of music.","The night feature has to be my favourite one on the Samsung S20 FE. When taking photographs with friends during the evenings and nightime it’s always been an issue for us to get the perfect shot. Flash is often too bright, therefore this night feature works perfectly for my friends and I. The night feature will basically shoot several frames at once, adjusting itself in order to pull in light and processes them into one clear brighter image.","","","","See more","Download Portfolio","Galaxy S20 FE","Galaxy S20 FE","Articles"],"meta":{"icon":"article","tags":[]}},{"id":"creativity|graduate-fashion-week|student-blog|tabatha-lopez","title":"Talking fashion, photography & tech with Tabatha","description":"","image":"https://images.samsung.com/is/image/samsung/assets/uk/explore/kings-cross/home-of-innovation/creativity/graduate-fashion-week/student-blog/tabatha-lopez/400-x-225.jpg","category":"creativity","url":"/uk/explore/kings-cross/creativity/graduate-fashion-week/student-blog/tabatha-lopez","values":["Talking fashion, photography & tech with Tabatha","","","","Talking fashion, photography & tech with Tabatha","As a fashion photographer, what is it that inspires you?","My work is often centred around themes such as the everyday, identity and youth culture. I have always been enticed to capture people’s life stories and used everything around me as a source of inspiration which I then translate into my shoots.","I often chose to shoot non-models, as I believe they can transmit so much more emotion and narrative into a photograph. Viewers are also able to form stronger emotions to the images, as they may feel it is more relatable to them.","When it comes to looking for inspiration, I also love looking through old magazines and shoots from the 90’s and early 00’s. The fashion image as people knew it for, had evolved from highly glamorised fashion shoots to more intimate photographs which were captured to look like day-to-day life snapshots. I think it’s this newfound rawness in the images which I feel so attracted to. I love capturing things for what they really are in life","","","What would you say has been the impact of tech on your journey?","My work is all produced using a ﬁlm camera. I believe that shooting on ﬁlm, not only creates more of a rawness to each image, but also has a very interesting process to it, which I really enjoy taking part in. I think there is something quite special about putting so much effort and time into producing an image. You allow yourself to take a step back and really think about what it is you want to translate within that image, and as a result you are more precise with the ﬁnal outcome.","Technology plays a big role within my pre-production and postproduction work. Social media websites such as Instagram and Facebook have made it more accessible for photographers to be able to scout for models, locations and contact collaborators.","Having software such as Photoshop and InDesign, allows me to do this without having to print images, and allows me to work on my ﬁnal images anywhere that I wish to, as long as I have my laptop with me. Furthermore, with the use of technology, more creatives have been given the chance to be able to publish their own work, and as a result been able to distribute themselves to greater audiences.","","","How has smartphone photography inspired your work? ","Smartphone photography is something which I often use in order to scout for locations.","Wide angle effects, for example, enable us to capture images from different perspectives, something of which we weren't able to do previously.  These sorts of effects come in great when capturing locations, as we are able to capture more within the image.","It is also great to use when experimenting with the composition of your image, as you can see results instantly. It is good to have an idea of what you want your image to look like before committing and using up your film.","Nowadays, smartphone cameras have an amazing quality. They are portable as well, which means you will never have to miss out on a photographic opportunity.","","How do you see the future for this area?","Technology really is impacting the world around us a little bit more each day. Regarding the creative industry, it really is opening up a lot of ways in which we can connect with one another and express ourselves as individuals.","A great example of this can be seen throughout the many creative ways that the designers have been showcasing their garments within the digital showcase of both London Fashion Week and Graduate Fashion Week at Samsung KX.","As human beings we are always ﬁnding new ways to create and display work, and I really do think technology plays a big role in allowing us to do this.","","","Articles"],"meta":{"icon":"article","tags":[]}},{"id":"creativity|innovation-sessions","title":"Innovation Sessions","description":"Description for Innovation Sessions","image":"https://images.samsung.com/is/image/samsung/assets/uk/explore/kings-cross/home-of-innovation/creativity/innovation-sessions/E1_Hero.jpg","category":"creativity","url":"/uk/explore/kings-cross/creativity/innovation-sessions","values":["Innovation Sessions","Description for Innovation Sessions","Pictured three women - Kirsti Hadley, Carrie Anne, Sapphire Bates - overlayed with different coloured shapes","Innovation Sessions","Episodes"],"meta":{"icon":"series","tags":[]}},{"id":"creativity|innovation-sessions|adam-gemili-rachel-ama-get-fit-get-cooking","title":"Innovation Sessions: Get fit and get cooking","description":"A brand-new digital series from the Home of Innovation to inspire the UK","image":"https://images.samsung.com/is/image/samsung/assets/uk/explore/kings-cross/home-of-innovation/creativity/innovation-sessions/thumbs/02_SAMSUNG_Session_06_Thumnail_400x255_v2.jpg","category":"creativity","url":"/uk/explore/kings-cross/creativity/innovation-sessions/adam-gemili-rachel-ama-get-fit-get-cooking","values":["Innovation Sessions: Get fit and get cooking","A brand-new digital series from the Home of Innovation to inspire the UK","","","Innovation Sessions: Get fit and get cooking","Series Overview:","Welcome to the Innovation Sessions.

An interesting background can add a lot of personality and drama to your portrait, helping you stand out. Next time you see a great piece of wall art, an interesting texture or a clear blue sky, try taking a moment to get a photo of yourself in front of it!","Alternatively, with modern day mobile devices like the Galaxy S21 that we showcase in Remote Capture, you can play around with Studio Lighting modes and create a more natural portrait expression by blurring the background, adding even more emphasis to your portrait.","Tip 2. All about the lighting","Illumination with soft or hard light is a must for all portrait photography. When setting up your portrait, it’s best practice to try and avoid low light and aim for natural sunlight if possible. ","Using the Galaxy S21, the Bright Night feature allows you to capture amazing detail in low-light environments. Alternatively, sunlight through a window is some of the best lighting you can use for smartphone portrait photography. If you can’t get close to a window for your perfect portrait, you can invest in some great lights for your home to set up where you want.","Lastly on lighting, get creative. Use the light cleverly on objects around you, play around with the placements of your light to create a mood for the photo, and in general have some fun with it.","Tip 3. Use a good camera ","It’s all about the camera. I am lucky enough to do photography for a career so have all the set-ups I need for amazing portrait shots. But the great thing about modern day devices like the Galaxy S21 is that you don’t need a lot of professional equipment to get a great shot.","You can deliver studio quality portrait mode photos with limited editing – trust me, you won’t be disappointed!","Tip 4. Use props to highlight your personality & tell your story ","Add creativity, character and interest to your portrait by adding props. Using props effectively can help add character and interest to your portrait, helping give the viewer a better idea of who you are and allowing you stand out on your professional profile. It’s a great way of including your personality in the images.","Tip 5. Strike a pose!","You can have the best camera, the best background, the best lighting, but the shot still relies on you to be you, and to pull your best pose.","Many people have favourite angles of themselves – so use your best angle, show off those features you’re proud of, work on what face you want to pull depending on the shot, and have some fun.","The best shots I take of people are when they are at their most natural and when they already know what works for them in a shot. Smiling how they’d normally smile, behaving completely authentically, and knowing that it can sometimes take 5 to 10 takes to get the right shot – so to enjoy the process.","Articles"],"meta":{"icon":"article","tags":[]}},{"id":"creativity|personal-branding|how-to-rebrand-your-online-presence","title":"Powerful Personal Branding Q&A: How to rebrand your online presence","description":"","image":"https://images.samsung.com/is/image/samsung/assets/uk/explore/kings-cross/home-of-innovation/creativity/personal-branding/how-to-rebrand-your-online-presence/01_Samsung_Remote_Capture_WEB_Thumbnail_V3.jpg","category":"creativity","url":"/uk/explore/kings-cross/creativity/personal-branding/how-to-rebrand-your-online-presence","values":["Powerful Personal Branding Q&A: How to rebrand your online presence","","","","Powerful Personal Branding Q&A: How to rebrand your online presence","In a pre-recorded Q&A, Chelcee Grimes, Ashley Verse and Ash Jones answer frequently asked questions and misconceptions around how to rebrand your online presence.

Ash Jones shares his top 3 tips","","","","Improving your professional online presence? Ash Jones shares his top 3 tips","Personal branding is key in 2021. A simple black and white CV listing your previous job history and education may have sufficed to get you noticed in the past, but now employers are looking for more, and the competition is strong for all industries.","As an employer, and as part of my day to day at Great Influence and in my previous job at Social Chain, I have seen it all when it comes to prospect employees looking to stand out. We had owls flying into the office with CVs attached, we’ve had videos – both good and bad, and we’ve had some instances where a CV isn’t required whatsoever.","When it comes to getting recognised, if done correctly, all of the above and more can work (yes, even the owl). Here are my three top tips for getting yourself recognised when self-branding and applying for new jobs.","Tip 1: Use a strong portrait, or video, that exemplifies what you’re about","A strong portrait picture instantly tells a story about you to the employer. Through clever use of props, colour, and expression you can show off a lot about yourself. The key here is not to confirm to the norm and play it safe. If you’re a chilled person, a yoga matt in the background of your shot tells me that. If you’re energetic, use of bright colours as your background will give this impression. The key is to not look too serious and to use your photo to tell your story – or even a video!","For the above, the Galaxy S21’s portrait mode is a huge help and can help deliver some really stand out shots, as we learnt on the Powerful Personal Branding shoot with Chelcee Grimes and Ashley Verse. You can change and blur backgrounds, edit the colours, and essentially get a studio quality photo from your homes using the Bright Night mode.","Tip 2: Show off your personality","Employers get so many CVs and on average, they will only look at these for approximately 5 seconds. If you’re applying for the right job, your education and previous job history should not be the first thing you show. We want to know all about you – the character you’d bring to an office, the hobbies you’re into, what you do on your weekends. ","Don’t be afraid to put things on your CV that show off your character. Think of it like a social media channel. Would you follow if it was dull and boring? No. But if you’re reading about an interest in sport, music, gaming, reading and more – you’re getting a great idea about the potential employee and whether they are suitable to the job, and to work with the staff the company already employs.","Tip 3: Sort out those socials!","Very often I will actually look at someone’s social media channels before I read their CV, and this is common for employers. It’s a window into your life that we want to know about and can make or break the employment process from the off.","The first tip here is to have your social channels on private. If there’s clearly images and videos that you wouldn’t want your employer to see. Yes, they want to see personality – but they don’t want to see you on a strip in Magaluf!","If your socials are a bit more sensible, and not on private, make sure the content really sells you. For example, interesting photography, showcasing elements like travelling. All these things tell us a lot and help us understand your character.","The final tip for socials is considering separate work socials to personal socials. This way you can keep your personal social channels on private, but you can point us to your work ones. Consider it a form of a social media CV – some of the great projects you’ve worked on, some of that great travelling photography I mention above, and some interesting content around what you’re into – for example the latest book you’ve read and your view on it, or the latest hobby you’ve undertaken and why.","Begin creating your stand out powerful personal profile with Ash Jones’ exclusively designed CV template.","Download CV Template","Articles"],"meta":{"icon":"article","tags":[]}},{"id":"creativity|personal-branding|professional-portraits-on-the-s21","title":"Powerful Personal Branding: Professional portraits on the S21","description":"","image":"https://images.samsung.com/is/image/samsung/assets/uk/explore/kings-cross/home-of-innovation/creativity/personal-branding/01_Samsung_Remote_Capture_Thumbnail_400x255_V3.jpg","category":"creativity","url":"/uk/explore/kings-cross/creativity/personal-branding/professional-portraits-on-the-s21","values":["Powerful Personal Branding: Professional portraits on the S21","","","","Powerful Personal Branding: Professional portraits on the S21","In Episode 1, fashion and music photographer Ashley Verse teaches Chelcee Grimes how to get that perfect professional portrait using the Samsung Galaxy S21.","Shoot adhered to social distancing measures and all subjects on set undertook COVID tests before taking part","Articles"],"meta":{"icon":"video","tags":[]}},{"id":"creativity|personal-branding|psychology-of-a-portrait","title":"Powerful Personal Branding: Psychology of a portrait","description":"","image":"https://images.samsung.com/is/image/samsung/assets/uk/explore/kings-cross/home-of-innovation/creativity/personal-branding/03_Samsung_Remote_Capture_WEB_Thumbnail_Ash_Chelcee_V1.jpg","category":"creativity","url":"/uk/explore/kings-cross/creativity/personal-branding/psychology-of-a-portrait","values":["Powerful Personal Branding: Psychology of a portrait","","","","Powerful Personal Branding: Psychology of a portrait","In Episode 2, career guru Ash Jones talks Chelcee Grimes through all things personal branding, offering his top tips and tricks on how to build your online presence and stand out amognst the crowd.","Articles"],"meta":{"icon":"video","tags":[]}},{"id":"creativity|samsung-spotlight","title":"Samsung Spotlight","description":"","image":"https://images.samsung.com/is/image/samsung/assets/uk/explore/kings-cross/home-of-innovation/creativity/samsung-spotlight/PinPep_SamsungSpotlight_PaulMescal_006_thumb.jpg","category":"creativity","url":"/uk/explore/kings-cross/creativity/samsung-spotlight","values":["Samsung Spotlight","","","","Samsung Spotlight","The Samsung Spotlight initiative, launched by Samsung UK in December 2020, was created to support performing artists in the wake of the pandemic, offering them a platform to showcase their skills to the nation.  Samsung encouraged arts students and creators from the UK & Ireland to film and submit audition-style performances to Instagram using #SamsungSpotlight, to shine a spotlight on those who had lost their stage due to COVID-19.","The winners were selected by Samsung Spotlight collaborator, Paul Mescal, who inspired entries through his contemporary dance routine titled ‘Lockdown’, all shot with Samsung Galaxy S20 in ultra-high 8K definition.","The winners, Michael Lynch, Adrian Mujkanovic and Adeola Yemitan were selected from over 300 entries and truly brought to life the spirit of the project crafting films which celebrated creativity and uniqueness during the pandemic.","Michael Lynch - 'Mime'","Michael Lynch is a 25-year-old performer, theatre maker and independent filmmaker who is passionate about movement and its ability to produce exciting theatre. Originally from Doncaster, South Yorkshire, he now lives in Southend-On-Sea in Essex where he began his performing arts training at East 15 Acting School after aspiring to perform and direct theatre.","He graduated from the school in 2019, specialising in Physical Theatre and is now the artistic director of his own theatre company, Project Lockout, which he set up among fellow artists and friends.","For his entry, ‘Mime’, Michael spent two days in his room writing, making noises in a microphone, and performing in front of a mirror. Michael said that his experience with Samsung Spotlight has added to the sense of community, encouragement and support that is vital for the arts during the pandemic.","Adrian Mujkanovic - 'Restricted'","23-year-old Adrian Mujkanovic, originally from Zagreb in Croatia, is a First-Year student at The Lir Academy in Dublin, the same school that Paul Mescal trained in prior to his success with Normal People. He travelled to Dublin with a desire to study and explore a new city however, like many others in higher education, his lessons have moved online which he feels has distanced him from his goals. Despite this, he’s grateful to his teachers at The Lir who have been persistent in their support throughout the pandemic.","Despite these restrictions, Adrian believes that his involvement in the initiative is demonstrative of how people in the arts are still creating, performing and adapting to new challenges. His entry ‘RESTRICTED’ draws on his desire to explore Dublin as he shared some of the locations he’s discovered during his time in the city. Adrian has said that the Samsung Spotlight initiative has reminded him that life doesn’t happen in front of a computer screen; it happens beyond the walls of our rooms.","Adeola Yemitan - 'Mystery'","Previously training in fine art and architecture, Adeola Yemitan from Croydon, London found her way into acting through her faith and an aspiration explore the truth. She is currently training at the National Youth Theatre in London and has said that for her, the learning experience of a live performance is unparalleled and whilst the NYT has been great in using film to share their work, there is nothing like performing in front of an audience.","For Adeola, words in many forms: journaling, spoken word, poetry and music are the most powerful means of prompting individuals to reflect and change. Spoken word, poetry and music are also forms that she explored in her entry titled ‘Mystery’.","Samsung Spotlight was created to give performers a platform to showcase their talents. The campaign launched in partnership with breakthrough actor of 2020 Paul Mescal, who created a visual representation of his Lockdown experience through a contemporary dance.","How to Shoot in 8K and Watch in 8K from home","The Samsung Galaxy S20 and S21 series allow you to shoot your favourite moments in highly detailed 8K video quality.

Kevin Cheung, retired esports pro turned esports University lecturer at Staffordshire University gives us an overview into this fast-paced world. ","1. Understanding the three pillars of esports","The best place to start with understanding the professional world of esports are with the industries three key pillars. Competition, entertainment and community. These are the fundamental ingredients that lead to the support, growth and the success of the esports industry.","Competition","Where the stars are born and where their legends are cemented into esports history. Whether league or a tournament, competition events are where the players and team organisations get their moment to shine and make a successful name for themselves.","Competitions are the industry’s lifeblood and key growth pillar as they provide the entertainment for esports fans.","Entertainment","Esports broadcast productions play such an essential part within the industry as they share and connect the wider fan base globally.","Major esports titles are reaching hundreds, thousands and even millions of viewers online and they have a big role to play to keep people coming back for more.","Community","The community, the fans, the gaming audience, they are truly the driving force behind the esports ecosystem. That’s why every individual has their place within esports.","Whether an audience member watching the spectacle unfold online or in the arena, or content creators building the hype with highlight reels for social - the Community provides the exposure necessary to support the esports ecosystem from a business and financial perspective.","They’re the reason for sponsorships, partnerships and endorsements expanding the esports market.","2. How does the UK scene compare globally?","The UK is currently behind other major regions such as Europe, North America and Asia. But why - without the restrictions of other regions such as legislation, regulation and culture, surely the UK should be striving?","One of the major factors preventing the UK’s growth is negative stigma. It’s still prevalent around both gaming and esports.","The idea that gaming is for ‘nerds’, that it is a waste of time and not a ‘real career’ is preventing people from pursuing esports as a serious pathway. However, the public sentiment is starting to shift. More and more people are now being exposed to the world of esports and moving the conversation away from \"What is esports?\" towards \"Why is esports so successful and how do I become a part of it?\"","We see evidence of this as more support and investments come into the esports ecosystem from non-endemic companies. This is not only helping change stereotypes but helps to solve one of the other issues facing the UK esports scene - the lack of funding.","A third issue for the UK is exposure but luckily this is also taking a turn. With the recent million dollar success of Excel Esports', Jaden ‘Wolfiez’ Ashman, the UK mainstream media is beginning to not only take notice but report regularly on the esports industry.","Education is also helping to shift negative perceptions. With BA honours esports courses, such as our own at Staffordshire University, education is also now helping to combat the stigma and help propel talented individuals into a successful career in esports. One that exists beyond making it as a pro player.","Although improvements are being made and we’re seeing a rise in the growth of the UK esports scene there are still some key things we need to work on as a community. Firstly, more competitions so more UK players can shine, more reliable internet across the UK and a more supportive community as we stamp out any toxicity. This is something we can all action.","3. The career path for an esports pro","The path ahead for esports professionals differ in many ways and yet may converge down a similar path.","For aspiring esports players, many careers have humble beginnings born from the love of the esports titles they play. That passion paired with the additional drive for competition, lead many to either look for a team or to be scouted. Others, including myself, create and form their own teams. This can commence a difficult path ahead with many obstacles, risks and sacrifices.","It must also be said that with many individuals starting their careers whilst still in education it’s no surprise that many young players find themselves in the tough decision between prioritising their studies or attempting to go pro. They face the conundrum of whether to pursue their dreams in hopes of competitive success or to continue with their education for reliability and future security. And with many gamers retiring at a young age there needs to be a backup plan.","So, what happens after you reach your pro peak?","Whether players make it to huge global success or not, there are still many great career opportunities within esports for retired players. Many ex-pros remain in the competitive space and take upon supportive roles such as coaching.","Others may look to pursue a career within On-Air Talent and become Shoutcasters and Analysts for Live Broadcast Production of esports events.  These roles allow ex-players to stay relevant and put their knowledge and skills to good use outside of the competitive stage. And of course, it’s common for many retired professionals to find their place within the world of Live Streaming and Content Creation.","Some of the more entrepreneurial individuals have found themselves pursuing their own esports business ventures.

We spoke to Wolfiez, Deadly and Alliestrasza to tell us four interesting, and unexpected things that they do to keep them at the top of their game.","1. Pro gamers stretch before a game","Much like elite sport stars, gamers prevent injury through a series of comprehensive warmups, working their fingers as well as hand and arm stretching. Get limbered up before you compete to stay pain-free and maximise your gameplay – game on!","2. Meditating gives many players the competitive edge","It’s not all about the physical gameplay. Before any game, take a holistic approach of visualising and rehearsing scenarios in the mind, this is an important way to remain calm, focused and motivated, whilst increasing competitive performance.","3. Team sessions to analyse game play","Working with coaches and analysers, elite gamers review all their game play footage, as well as their competitors’ matches. Players can track their achievements, analyse past gameplay behaviour and devise new winning strategies; an integral part of getting to the top.","4. Team bonding is everything","For team esports stars, it’s crucial that there is a natural chemistry between the players online and offline, so they play better together in game. Within the EXCEL players house they have board game nights, watch movies together, go bowling, and more. They’re friends first, and elite competitors second.","","So, for the next generation of gamers, of course it’s important you put the time in gaming, but there is so much more to be an elite gamer. Get stretching, take a bit of time to meditate, analyse your gameplay and keep building those friendships.","Articles"],"meta":{"icon":"article","tags":[]}},{"id":"innovation|next-level-gaming|meet-the-game-changers","title":"Meet the Game Changers","description":"Powered by Samsung, we get an insider view of the world behind the games.","image":"https://images.samsung.com/is/image/samsung/assets/uk/explore/kings-cross/home-of-innovation/innovation/next-level-gaming/Samsung_NextLevel_400x255_3Talent.jpg","category":"innovation","url":"/uk/explore/kings-cross/innovation/next-level-gaming/meet-the-game-changers","values":["Meet the Game Changers","Powered by Samsung, we get an insider view of the world behind the games.","","Meet the Game Changers","The esports industry is growing rapidly worldwide and with everything from million pound players to dedicated esports university degrees - the UK’s scene is rising up to be a serious contender.","Avid gamer and footballer, Chelcee Grimes, gets an insider view of the world behind the games as she meets the UK’s lead esports pros at Samsung KX.","Watch as Wolfiez, Deadly and Alliestrasza tell us what’s next for them and the industry as they test out the Odyssey G9.","Articles"],"meta":{"icon":"video","tags":[]}},{"id":"innovation|next-level-gaming|wolfiez-pro-gaming-secrets","title":"Pro Gamer Secrets with Jaden 'Wolfiez' Ashman","description":"Powered by Odyssey G9, get an insider view of the professional world of esports.","image":"https://images.samsung.com/is/image/samsung/assets/uk/explore/kings-cross/home-of-innovation/innovation/next-level-gaming/Samsung_NextLevel_400x255_Jayden.jpg","category":"innovation","url":"/uk/explore/kings-cross/innovation/next-level-gaming/wolfiez-pro-gaming-secrets","values":["Pro Gamer Secrets with Jaden 'Wolfiez' Ashman","Powered by Odyssey G9, get an insider view of the professional world of esports.","","Pro Gamer Secrets with Jaden 'Wolfiez' Ashman","Jaden ‘Wolfiez’ Ashman teaches avid gamer and pro footballer Chelcee Grimes, his personal grips, settings and setup that make him a Fortnite esports world champion.

Science Museum Group","Throughout our long-standing partnership with the Science Museum Group, we have worked together to inform, inspire and engage millions of people across the UK with STEM subjects. Most recently we have been bringing to life the amazing science behind space travel through our Space Descent VR Lounge  at the Science Museum, which gives audiences the chance to experience Tim Peake’s incredible journey from the International Space Station (ISS) back to Earth through stunning virtual reality.","This follows our nationwide tour of Tim Peake’s Spacecraft which saw the Soyuz TMA-19M capsule land in various destinations across the UK from 2017 to 2019, inspiring millions of people with the wonders of space travel through an educational outreach programme and interactive VR experience for schools and communities.","Now, at a time when all forms of travel are limited (space or otherwise!), we’ve revisited Tim Peake’s interview at the Science and Industry Museum, part of the Manchester Science Festival, to bring you some of the most interesting and bizarre insights from his space adventure…","1. During the ascent into space, Tim Peake’s rocket reached up to 4.5Gs, which he describes as around 10 times the speed of a bullet. If you can’t quite get your head around that, he likens the feeling to being in Lewis Hamilton’s F1 car for eight minutes 48 seconds.","2. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Tim says his favourite thing about being up in space was the view, although some iconic landmarks were harder to spot than others. It took him 6 - 7 weeks to get a two second glimpse of Antarctica from the ISS, just long enough to take a quick snap!","3. His second favourite thing about being in space was floating. If you’ve ever dreamt you’re flying, you can probably imagine how cool this would be. But picture this - according to Tim, he could actually work on the ceiling and the walls! The only downside to floating in space Tim says, is that it takes time to get used to walking back on Earth afterwards where gravity keeps you firmly grounded!","4. You grow in space - according to Tim, you can grow about an inch and a half taller, which can cause a bit of back pain in the first few weeks (ouch). Apparently it’s short lived once back on Earth though, as gravity shrinks you to back to normal size.","5. During Tim’s time aboard the ISS, 85-90% of urine got recycled back into drinking water - we’ll leave you to decide what you think about that!","6. If we’re lucky, Tim speculates there could be another journey to the moon on the cards in the late 2020s (the last moon landing was almost 50 years ago in 1972!), but he predicts it might not be until the 2030s or 2040s that humans are ready to voyage to Mars.","7. It took Tim two and half years to train for his six month mission, but as he quite rightly points out, “you train to be an astronaut your entire life” - so really, what’s two years, eh?","You can watch the full video above","Discover more","Learn more"],"meta":{"icon":"article","tags":[]}},{"id":"innovation|science-museum|2","title":"Stay Learning: Samsung presents \"The Faces of Space Travel\" with the Science Museum","description":"Through Samsung's partnership with the Science Museum, we bring to life the amazing science behind space travel by remembering some great firsts in space history.","image":"https://images.samsung.com/is/image/samsung/assets/uk/explore/kings-cross/home-of-innovation/innovation/science-museum/kx-science-museum-2-thumb.jpg","category":"innovation","url":"/uk/explore/kings-cross/innovation/science-museum/2","values":["Stay Learning: Samsung presents \"The Faces of Space Travel\" with the Science Museum","Through Samsung's partnership with the Science Museum, we bring to life the amazing science behind space travel by remembering some great firsts in space history.","A woman, Helen Sharman, the first British space explorer, stands facing the camera smiling next to a retro astronaunt suit","A woman, Helen Sharman, the first British space explorer, stands facing the camera smiling next to a retro astronaunt suit","Stay Learning: Samsung presents \"The Faces of Space Travel\" with the Science Museum","Throughout our long-standing partnership with the Science Museum Group, we have worked together to inform, inspire and engage millions of people across the UK with STEM subjects.

The First Man in Space: Yuri Gagarin","On 12 April 1961, Soviet pilot and cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human to fly to outer space, he was just 27 years-old at the time - completing an orbit of the Earth in his Vostok spacecraft in 108 minutes.","2. The First Woman in Space: Valentina Tereshkova","On 16 June 1963, 26-year-old Valentina Tereshkova became the first woman to fly in space, completing 48 orbits of the Earth in three days!","To this day she remains the only woman to have flown in space on a solo mission.","3.The First Astronauts to walk on the Moon: Neil Armstrong & Buzz Aldrin","On 16 July 1969, Apollo 11 launched from Cape Kennedy with Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin aboard. ","Four days later, around 650 million people worldwide watched as Neil Armstrong became the first man to set foot on the moon, followed by Buzz Aldrin, making it one of the most watched moments in TV history.","4.The First Brit in Space: Helen Sharman","In 1991, at the age of 27, Helen Sharman became the first Brit to venture into outer  space. Setting off on 18 May, she spent eight days in space, mainly at the Mir space station - a Russian Space Station that spent 15 years in orbit from 1986 (three times its expected lifetime).","Before becoming the first British space explorer, Helen Sharman worked as a chemist for Mars, making ice cream and chocolate.","Discover more","Check out videos from the Science Museum below to learn more","1.

In fact it’s very much in our hands, in so much of the technology we use day-to-day. Face detection helping you capture that perfect shot on your phones, that uses AI. The TVs ability to predict what series you might like, that also uses AI. That spam filter on your emails - you guessed it, AI.

Fast forward to 1937 and Dr. William Frederick Gericke of the University of California at Berkeley coined the term ‘hydroponics’ - growing without soil using simply water and nutrients to raise a 7m high tomato plant.","This novel way of growing quickly became a mainstay of commercial growers and the agricultural communities during the 40’s, 50’s and 60’s, resulting in a transformation of growth rates, space use, water efficiency (up to 75% less water) and better control of pests and diseases.","Hydroponic systems today are very modern systems for growing food using controlled environments in which vegetables and leafy greens grow all using technology and connected devices to automate lighting, nutrient delivery, temperature, light spectrum, humidity and even pest detection. Hydroponics are also creating new opportunities to grow at home; for example using Samsung SmartThings to grow your own microgreens in a spare room with your phone to control lighting, water levels, and even notify you when things leak. ","Our cities are changing and modern hydroponics are now appearing on city rooftops, inside hidden underground tunnels and high-tech shipping containers producing food; everything from microgreens, salads, herbs, vegetables, spices and fruits.","COOK","We waste approximately a third of all the food we produce; either at the farm, the supermarket or household. Reducing food waste through better meal planning and smarter buying habits is something the Samsung Family Hub can help with. Imagine if your fridge can tell you what’s inside, when it’ll expire and how many of those tasty plant based sausages you have left before you buy another packet.","Whilst busy professionals struggling to find interesting ways to prepare meals with random left over collections of food, herbs and veggies in their Samsung Family Hub, can ask the fridge to even suggest recipes, ensuring not only help you reduce food waste, but most likely save you money.","EAT","Probably not high on your shopping list, but insects form part of a new trend in alternative protein sources; using as little as 1 litre of water you can produce 1 kilo of insects, compared with 15,000 litres for a comparable kilo of beef. These little critters pack a real punch when it comes to protein sources, with 2 to 3 times more complete protein. Crickets, mealworms, grasshoppers, and buffalo worms are ideal for snacking, and in sufficient quantities can be ground as flour for bread, shakes, pizza bases, cookies or stews.","Contributing to a healthier gut are the probiotics and fermented foods that have been passed down through many generations that are making a resurgence as part of healthier lifestyles. Kefir and Kombucha are two very popular fermented drinks that deliver a beneficial mix of live bacteria to balance your gut health.","The future of food is a culinary adventure that balances new ways of growing our food, innovation in how we prepare new exciting ingredients, flavours and experiences that make it easier for us to grow, cook and eat more sustainably.","More articles"],"meta":{"icon":"article","tags":[]}},{"id":"innovation|taste-of-tomorrow|recipes-any-greens","title":"Any Greens by Sara Kiyo Popowa","description":"Seed Pesto recipe","image":"https://images.samsung.com/is/image/samsung/assets/uk/explore/kings-cross/home-of-innovation/innovation/taste-of-tomorrow/08b_Samsung_Website_TOT_How_To_Recipes_400x255_V2.jpg","category":"innovation","url":"/uk/explore/kings-cross/innovation/taste-of-tomorrow/recipes-any-greens","values":["Any Greens by Sara Kiyo Popowa","Seed Pesto recipe","","","Any Greens by Sara Kiyo Popowa","Seed Pesto over Smashed Roast Potatoes, Greens and Edible Flowers","You don’t need basil, pine nuts and parmesan to make your own delicious pesto to serve with crispy smashed potatoes.

From a child perspective, the device would need to have an element of customisation so that it can reflect their own personality, without alienating them from their social group. From a school perspective, the mask would need to match the school requirements around uniform, and yet also be standardised so that the adoption and usage remained high.","I felt that Owen had researched these areas well, and created a solution that understood the needs of each party in order to give the maximum chance of adoption, as well as considered the whole user journey of how the product would be purchased, customised and worn.","Well done!\"","Sebastian Stoddart.

Use recipes as a guide then add, streamline or swap with what you have, like or can get. Balance carbs, fat, protein and greens, your body needs a bit of everything and will just crave what it's deprived of. Apps are a good way to monitor this, try the Samsung Health app – it breaks down the calories and nutrients in each meal, so you know exactly what you're consuming.","You will possibly have heard of Samin Nosrat's book 'Salt, fat, acid, heat,' that really sums up what you need flavour wise in cooking for taste and satiety. Fat gives richness, even just cooking with a bit of butter gives so much difference - (try browned butter – you won't look back).  If not, a good olive oil, cheese, nut butter or tahini does the trick. You also need a salty element for that savoury satisfaction – step forward sea salt, olives, anchovies or even marmite. Balance that with a bit of acid – lemon juice, balsamic, capers or pickles for example. The heat could be chilli and spices, but these also add toasty, roasty cooking flavours to your dish.","Let's take it one step beyond and think about texture – a bit of crunch will make you feel more satisfied, and maybe even a pinch of sweetness if it goes, think dried fruit in a tagine. And there you go.","Here's a great recipe to demonstrate balance, adjust everything to suit how punchy you like it.","Quick Indian spiced salad","Makes 4 portionsFrom start to serve 5 mins","- 1-2 tbsp lime pickle – add to taste and depending how strong the pickle is","- 1-4 tsp lemon juice, cider or white wine vinegar – adjust depending on the acidity of the pickle","- 1-2 tbsp honey, maple syrup or light brown sugar – add to taste","- 3 tbsp extra virgin olive and 1tbsp lighter flavoured oil such as light olive or sunflower","- 2 heaped tbsp Greek yoghurt","- 1 Just whizz in a blender with 1-2tbsp of water until smooth then toss with some crunchy salad leaves","(if preferred, use mango chutney and cut out the syrup)","For the salad...","- A bit of crunchy lettuce and avocado should be enough, however feel free to add a bit extra, for example, cucumber, coriander, toasted almonds or pistachios, sesame seeds. A pinch of nigella seeds will give a lovely flavour twist. Make it more filling with chickpeas, boiled eggs, yoghurt or chicken.","Quick Indian spiced salad","2) Eating seasonally","Whether it's fresh produce, meat, grains or dairy - if it's been able to grow or mature naturally with minimal chemical or mechanical intervention, it's not only good for your bank balance and the environment, but it's also better for your health.","Rather than battling with the seasons to maintain supply of the same fruit and veg we should be listening to mother nature and eating the natural assortment the seasons provide; from fibrous vegetables like cabbage and broccoli in winter to antioxidant rich tomatoes and berries in summer. It will taste better, fresher and be more nutritious.","Cutting food miles and supporting local producers will improve the quality, availability and diversity of produce in future too, and your body - or rather your gut loves and needs variety to keep those microbes happy (though that also includes the occasional indulgence to keep your microbiome on its toes!).","Beetroot and brown rice pilaf","Beetroot is rich in antioxidants and fibre but it's rich earthy flavour can sometimes make people avoid it, however with the right spices and gentle cooking it's delicious, and an extra win – you can also eat the leaves as you would baby spinach.","Serves 2From start to serve 40 mins","- 1 medium onion, halved and thinly sliced","- 40g butter","- 1tbsp olive oil (we add oil with the butter as it has a higher burning point)","Flavour – middle eastern flavours are great with beetroot. Try 2-3tsp of has el hanout spice blend or harissa paste (if you can't get those, then 2tsp of roughly crushed cumin seeds is also good – add some warmth with around ½ tsp of cinnamon and/or cardamon pods, cayenne pepper or chilli if you like)","- 150g brown basmati rice","- 450ml veg or chicken stock (or water)","- 300g beetroot, (roughly 2) - peel and grate while the onions are cooking (swap for carrots if you prefer)","To serve – use what you have...","A drizzle of;","Tahini, Greek yoghurt, ricotta or feta, lemon juice, fresh pomegranate seeds, balsamic glaze/pomegranate or date molasses","A sprinkle of;","Parsley, coriander, mint or dill, toasted nuts – pine nuts, pistachios, hazelnuts or almonds, a few raisins or dried cherries. (if you make it curry based swap tahini for almond butter, lemon for lime and use a drizzle of tamarind)","1) Heat a wide heavy based pan over a high heat (roughly 20cm – size will affect cooking time and absorption) add the butter and oil, let it sizzle then add the onions and a pinch of salt. Stir fry for 1 min, reduce the heat to medium (you'll need to go slightly below medium if cooking on gas rather than electric). Cook the onion for 8 mins, stirring now and again. It should be lightly golden and translucent.","2) Add the ras el hanout (or harissa) and rice, mix well, and then fry for a minute more. Add the stock, mix well and bring to the boil - allow to boil for 2 mins then add the lid and reduce to a moderate simmer for 25 mins. Add the beetroot in a layer on top for the last 10 mins (work quickly so you keep in the heat).","3) Mix and season to taste, add herbs, drizzles and toppings to taste.","Beetroot and brown rice pilaf","3) Storage and waste","There are so many hacks to curb your food waste and save money, one part is knowing your produce and one-part is good storage. Here's a few tips...","- Wash leaves and herbs in ice cold water, dry with a salad spinner then store in sealed Tupperware. They'll keep fresh and crisp for up to 10 days.","- Trim vegetables before storing so they last longer and often you can use the leaves – cut the tops off carrots (the finer ends make a great pesto), trim beetroot leaves (fry with garlic as a side) and try chopping and pickling the stalks.","- On that note, save odds and ends of veg for pickling- cabbages are great or lighter veggies like cucumber and radish can take a 10-minute pickle if they're looking too sad for a salad.","- Vegetable trimmings are also great for stocks and boosting flavour in soups and sauces, bits of onions, leeks, stalks from herbs and all sorts. Keep them in the freezer until you have time to use them, same goes for meat, fish bones and prawn shells.","- Use or freeze sour milk or yoghurt to make soda bread or scones.","- You can even keep orange peels and dry in a low oven to crumble into to granola or yoghurt.","Don't forget to snap and share your dishes with #SamsungKX.","By Katy McClelland.","Katy is a freelance food stylist, recipe developer & food editor.

Between new types of always-online experiences, to full-blown remakes of classic games, as well as the latest and greatest in graphics and game design, this generation has had it all.","Here's a quick glimpse at some of the most memorable experiences we've had over the last seven years.","Fun With Friends","","Image Credit: Fortnite. Colourful and chaotic, Fortnite has become a cultural moment","Ok, let's get the obvious one out of the way. Fortnite has transcended gaming to become a platform in its own right. Its bright colours and easy-to-learn but difficult-to-master building mechanics make it the complete antithesis of every other \"Battle Royale\" game out there, and it's become a place where friends get together to squad up, find secrets, and compete with other players. No game since Minecraft has become such a pop-culture phenomenon, and it's unlikely anything will, again. In fact, you can download it to your smartphone right now and see what the fuss is about!","","For The Competitors","","Image Credit: Rainbow Six Siege. The best tactical shooter on consoles, no two matches of Siege are the same","Esports has become universal in certain franchises, but in terms of that sweaty-palmed, controller-clutching competition, Rainbow Six: Siege is an easy recommendation. Despite launching all the way back in 2015, the game gets new content multiple times per year. That includes new maps, new characters with their own unique abilities, and even changes to what's already there, just to keep you on your toes. Each Operator is fun to learn and teaming up with friends to navigate destructible environments never gets old.","","The Everlasting Gobstopper","","Image Credit: Destiny 2. After a rocky start, Destiny 2 has become the game that keeps on giving","Destiny 2 may have launched with a shallow pool of content, but the game (not unlike Rainbow Six: Siege) has grown over time as expansions have built out the game's universe, both in terms of things to do and stories to tell. Offering arguably the best play fighting of any game on console, Destiny 2 is the kind of game that’s easy to get lost in, in the best way. Whether you're teaming up with friends to take on other players or banding with Guardians to take on one of the game's puzzle-filled Raids, there's still nothing quite like it.","","Petrolheads, Rejoice!","","Image Credit: Forza Horizon 4. Forza Horizon 4 might just be the best driving game, ever.","While Gran Turismo and Forza Motorsport have traded paint to earn the chequered flag that would crown them the best racing game franchise, the latter's spin-off Horizon became a sensation with Forza Horizon 4. Offering an open-world replica of the United Kingdom to race, drift, and jump around; it's absolutely stunning to look at and incredibly approachable for newcomers and seasoned sim-racing fans alike. With secrets to uncover around every bend, it's the best driving game around and will keep you coming back with seasonal changes to its huge map.","","A True Open World","","Image Credit: Red Dead Redemption 2. The world of Red Dead is almost impossibly vast, and with so much to do.","Red Dead Redemption 2 is a slow-burn, cowboy epic that'll take over seventy hours to play through - and even then, there's a good chance you won't see everything. In fact, the real charm of Red Dead Redemption 2's lawless frontier is that it feels as though it's constantly moving and evolving, regardless of your character's input. With incredible attention to detail, you'll want to take your time with the story, before jumping back into the world with its sprawling online mode.","","A Harrowing Tale of Revenge","","Image Credit: TLOU2. Not for the faint of heart, The Last of Us Part 2 is a watershed moment in gaming.","The Last of Us is considered by many to be one of gaming's greats, and the decision to create a sequel was an undeniable risk. Thankfully, Ellie's tale of revenge is not only up to continuing the series' legacy of mature storytelling and nuanced writing and performances but takes everything the first game did in terms of gameplay and kicks it up a notch. Its stealth is more refined, combat is more brutal, and the game's mutated monsters are scarier than ever.

Get hyped, visualise success, watch your favourite Rocky montage and the rest will follow, right? Well, not so fast – the problem with motivation is that it doesn’t last, and the secret to real life-change is that it’s all about long-term consistency. And how do you guarantee the second one? Simple: build better habits.","Habits rule our lives: some studies [1] estimate that as many as 40% of our daily actions aren’t the result of conscious decisions*, but ingrained actions. You already have some good ones: you (probably) brush your teeth twice a day, and you (hopefully) don’t need a playlist to get it done. The trick is to make other healthy behaviours automatic, so that you eat well and exercise just as regularly. How? Here’s how.","Start small","Aim to hit the gym for 60 minutes, five days a week, and you’re setting yourself up for disappointment. Start by thinking smaller: aim to get to the gym three or even two days a week, for just twenty minutes, to make it easier to hit your goals. On days where you’re feeling really low, set your sights lower but keep the habit intact – going to the gym or park, doing a couple of stretches and leaving beats doing nothing at all. In the same way, eating a healthy, protein-rich breakfast (eggs, basically) every day beats prepping a feast on Monday and skipping it for the rest of the week. And on that topic...","Avoid 'zero' days","A 'zero' day is one where you don’t do anything productive towards your goal: not one single squat or effort at eating healthier. Aim to avoid these by setting yourself one micro-sized goal that you can accomplish as soon as you get up – nailing hydration by drinking a big glass of water once you are out of bed, or doing a short workout from one of the 120 your Samsung Galaxy Watch3 can offer. Alternatively, if the clock hits 11:58PM and you’ve had an unproductive day, do one thing: decide on a healthy recipe you’ll try later in the week, or do one rep of any exercise. Keep that streak going, but don’t fret if you do miss one single day.","Use habit stacking","One of the simplest ways to forge new habits is to ‘stack’ them on top of existing ones: pairing something you want to do with something you already do automatically. If you get up every morning and immediately put the kettle on, for instance, you might ‘stack’ the habit of doing some simple stretches while you wait for the kettle to boil. If you shower every morning, get in the habit of doing one all-out set of press-ups before you jump under the water. You can also do this with work or lifestyle habits - for instance, writing a line of a novel or meditating for a few minutes immediately when you finish up for the day. ","Think like a computer","Reprogramme your brain and you won’t even need to worry about making good decisions: they’ll happen automatically. Set up cues by using what behavioural scientists call If > Then patterns: “If I feel hungry before lunch, I’ll have an apple instead of a cupcake”, for instance. You can also change your thinking by changing the language you use around other people: “I don’t eat X” rather than “I can’t eat X” reminds you that you’re in control of the process.","And don’t be too hard on yourself","","The number of days it takes to really forge a new habit is contentious: some studies put it as low as 18, or as high as nearly three months. Stick at anything and you’ll eventually build it into your lifestyle, until the day comes when it’s easy and automatic. Until then, don’t worry - you’ll get there.","","By Joel Snape","Joel Snape is a freelance journalist, frequently contributing to titles including the Guardian, the Telegraph and Men’s Fitness.

The scalp helps promote healthy hair growth and regulate oil production. With this in mind, it’s time to start giving it a little attention. Dirt, sebum and dead skin can build up, leaving hair looking a little dull. Try protecting the scalp from pollution and stress with the Body Shop’s new Ginger Scalp Serum, £15 – it’s a fast-absorbing formula, helping to sooth dryness and rebalance oils between washes. Infused with ginger essential oil from Sri Lanka, white willow and birch bark, it helps improve scalp health leaving it flake free.","Smooth Operator","Whilst it’s important to celebrate our natural hair, sometimes we want to tame unwanted frizz or flyways. Avoid wrapping your hair in a towel post-wash as this can encourage frizz. Instead, use a softer fabric such as an old t-shirt. If you have time to air dry your hair, then style it whilst it’s still wet so that it dries smooth. There are an array of products claiming to tame frizz too. As a general rule, finer hair should stick to lighter formulas to avoid feeling too greasy, whilst thicker styles can handle heavier products. Lee Stafford’s Coco Loco With Agave Shine Oil, £7.99 is a no-mess overnight treatment. Apply a couple of drops before bed and wake up with silky soft, glossy hair. For curly hair, Only Curls Enhancing Curl Gel, £16, has avocado oil, kukui oil and aloe to add shine, moisture and hold the locks in place.","Bouncy blow-dry","Who doesn’t love that just-stepped-out-of-the-salon bounce? With the right tools, it’s easy to fake that feeling at home too. Firstly, it’s important your hair is protected with a defence spray such as TRESemmé Heat Defense Spray, £5.49. ‘If your hair is wet, give it a super quick rough dry. Section your hair starting from the top of your ears all the way round your head and clip up and out the way,’ says Aaron Carlo, Lead Stylist for TRESemmé. ‘Starting at the root, place a round brush underneath, angling your hairdryer at the top of your hair, following the brush as you move down. Make sure to keep the hair super tight round the brush. Repeat until the section is dry and move on to the rest of your sections,’ adds Aaron. A spritz of TRESemmé Flexible Hold Hair Spray, £4.99, will hold it in place, without any stiffness. Don’t forget to capture your tresses transformation with the Samsung Galaxy Note20. The 8K camera gives you ultra-high resolution for pro-looking videos and snaps.","Simple up dos","For those in-between wash days, an effortless up-do is a quick fix. Top knots look even better messy (thankfully!) and this chic laidback look can work for lounging about the house as well as a dinner date. Scoop your hair into a pony and wrap it loosely around the base, pinning in place. Tease a few more strands and add a loose curl to frame the face too. If you want to keep your hair away from your face, braids work wonders. Take it up a notch by weaving a silky scarf through the plait. Hair accessories are a great way of sprucing up any do, and provides a good distraction from pesky flyaways too. Add a nineties-style scrunchie to your ponytail, tame frizz with a hairband or add some decadence with a pretty pearl hairclip. More is more so layer on two or three clips for a catwalk-worthy finish.","Colour Crush","Securing a salon appointment can be as tricky as bagging a Glastonbury ticket so if you’ve got a while until your next hairdresser slot, it’s easy to give your colour a boost at-home, without reaching for any dodgy dyes. Charles Worthington Instant Root Concealer, £9.99, is quick drying, and instantly hides greys in one spritz, and then washes out. Blondes can brighten their hair with a purple shampoo or mask. L’Oreal Paris Elvive Colour Protect Intensive Purple Mask, £6 is a quick treatment that tackles brassy tones whilst nourishing hair damaged by colour, bleaching and washing.","","By Charlie Bell.","Charlie is a London-based fashion, beauty and lifestyle editor with over twelve years' experience in the media industry.

At the top of the sport, professional players and teams have recognised the need to adopt  more traditional sports approaches to support the development and wellbeing of players.","Some Pro teams have started to appreciate the need to manage players health, wellbeing, fitness, nutrition, psychology, sleep and recovery. This has not yet filtered down to the wider community.","I have spent time analysing gamers and esports players using my experience as an Occupational Therapist to analyse the impact of gaming on players. In my world occupation is classified as the things people need or want to do or has to do to have a good quality of life, enjoy themselves or contribute to their society. I have used an occupational science model called PEOP which analyses the Person, their Environment, their Occupation and their Performance to look at esports players. In this article we will focus on the “Person” in the model and how the physiological, cognitive, spiritual and psychological factors can impact a player’s performance. If we start with physiological, we examine strength and flexibility but also look at sleep patterns, nutrition, levels of inactivity and stress. Perhaps the most obvious and widely publicised concern for gamers is the lack of inactivity and need for physical exercise. This is important of course and a physical exercise regime must be part of any players program. Other factors can have an equally significant impact on players wellbeing and performance.","Stress","Balancing the stresses of competition with the balance of normal life is not easy. Within competitive sports, the esports player has evolved to be one of the most committed sports people with a player often spending 6 days a week with up to 12 hours a day game time. Stress, anxiety and lack of sleep from long periods of gaming can all impact your performance. Operating at high levels of prolonged stress can have a long-term impact on your health. Ensuring as a player you have a mechanism to switch off and a routine that provides time for mental recovery and gives you an ability to get a good night’s sleep are critical. The duration of time playing also leads to a number of potential physical impacts, with the level of RSI (Repetitive Strain Injury) impacting a large number of players. One of the main causes is the ergonomics of the gaming setup most people play on.","Nutrition","Nutrition is another important factor - the right diet can enhance your overall health and energy levels and enhance your visual and auditory processes leading to improved performance as a player. I have visited gaming tournaments and seen players consuming high-caffeine and high-sugar drinks which can give a short-term benefit but over a prolonged period these can lead to high heart rate, high blood pressure and put players at risk of developing diabetes or heart disease.","Cognition","Cognition is how we think, how we problem solve. For the esports player this means hand-eye coordination, visual processing skills and speeds, and an ability to maintain focus but also capability to absorb multiple inputs of information. Positively, cognition is like a muscle, you can train it to increase its performance. A number of the factors already mentioned including diet, exercise and reduced stress can do wonders for your cognitive function. Problem solving and puzzles help you to recall information that is not in the forefront of your brain and help with abstract and critical thinking. Exercises in logic and reasoning as well as trying new things like learning a language or playing music can all help stimulate cognitive abilities.","Spirituality","Spirituality in the context of our  analysis is not specifically related to  religion but focuses on what gives you meaning, what motivates you, what drives you. For the esports player as with any sports person this is typically winning but it starts with the basics. For you as a player it may be the achievement of a personal goal within a particular game, it may be the social element of meeting other players and competing or it may be the opportunity to forge a career in a sport  you are passionate about. It is typical competitive behaviour for us to want to be the best as quickly as possible and by any means necessary, but actions, routines and performance have no bearing on one’s inner-self. Each of us must be mindful of what it is that motivates us and use that as a positive factor in our development.","Psychological","Psychological factors are diverse and range from a player’s personality, self-esteem to mental health and self-awareness. While some players are part of a team, many play alone or certainly practice in isolation. There is a perception that many gamers are introverted and by placing themselves under high-pressure to achieve results can suffer from anxiety and feelings of isolation and loneliness. One thing I have learned in this analysis is that esports is a community and a vibrant one that is keen to support one another. As a player it is important that you maintain a good life balance between time playing and time socialising or engaging with people. Reward yourself for your achievements as you progress and reach out to friends and family for emotional support when needed. Most importantly give yourself time to unwind and remove stress.","","There are three things I’d recommend all players focus on as an initial step:","1) Adopt a mindful and sustainable approach to your game time. Ensure you control stress levels and have a balance between time gaming and time engaged in other activities.","2) Consider your set up and gaming environment. As you will be spending a large amount of time in the same place make sure it is supporting your body and be mindful of potential symptoms of RSI.","3) Manage your nutrition. Control your intake of higher sugar, higher fat foods and ensure you have a balanced diet.","All of us can improve our gaming performance and positively impact our health  and wellbeing. What is important is that all players of all levels take notice, occupational dysfunctions can dampen performance or limit it altogether if unchecked.","","By Level One - A digital-first publication for the widest definition of modern gamer","Level One represents lifestyle for modern gamers, through a belief that this is more than just the game.

What do you eat to get that advertised mental clarity and glowing temperament? As with most things, it’s not as simple as just adding a few new ingredients to your diet, it also requires working with your body and the earth.","Inside and out ","Whether aware or not, we are tuned into the seasons and we naturally gravitate towards what’s available - warming root vegetables and slow cooked meaty stews in the cooler months and lighter more energising salads and berries in the warmer months without even thinking about it. Beyond these cravings though, our bodies and the microbes in our gut have developed to work optimally with our heritage foods.","Food tastes better in season and it’s also more nutritious having gone straight from the field to you without being freighted, frozen, stored or forced into accelerated ripening. It’s good as well, to feel a connection to food and where it comes from, to be in tune with nature and feel a sense of scale with the earth. There’s evidence to support the health and happiness benefits of being close to nature, getting outside and being barefoot on the ground. A bit airy fairy you might think, but here’s a lovely bit of context – the rings you see when you slice into a beetroot, each one represents a cycle of the moon. You’re eating about half a year in those slices. But the modern global food system makes it hard to stay local and seasonal, supermarket shelves are stacked with the same products all year round (out of roughly 300,000 species of plants in the world, we eat about 200), so read those labels and go to farmers’ markets get to a direct line to the season’s best. This is when taking pictures of food really pays off – to see all the variety you’re getting in your diet. As a food stylist, I’m a sucker for the perfect Instagram shot of my food, whether I’m out and about or cooking at home. For this recipe, why not try using the crystal clear camera of the Samsung Galaxy S20FE for the ultimate shot. It’s such a value for money device and comes in the most beautiful colours. Despite the lower price point, it definitely doesn’t compromise on any of its quality.","","Perfect early Autumn recipe – roast spiced squash","Start to serve 1 hour, serves 2","Heat the oven to 180c, 160c fan.","Heat a good drizzle of light olive oil in a roasting tin then add 1 large squash cut into chunks and 5 bashed cloves of garlic. Toss in the oil with salt and pepper and roast for 45 mins – tossing halfway.","Meanwhile bring 120g whole grain barley or spelt to the boil in a saucepan and boil for 40 mins.","To make the spice rub; crush the seeds from 3 cardamom pods with ¾ tsp fennel seeds and mix with 1tsp black onion seeds, 1tsp urfa chilli flakes (or smoky dried chilli e.g. ancho/chipotle. Or use sumac for a milder taste).","For the last 10 mins of cooking time add the spice mix and a handful of hazelnuts to the squash - mix well.","Toss the squash and drained cooked barley in the tin with 1 sliced green chilli, a few handfuls of salad leaves, chopped parsley, extra virgin olive oil, a squeeze of lime juice and a little zest, extra urfa chilli and/or sumac and salt and pepper to taste. Serve with natural yoghurt.","","Gut feeling ","There are many foods that do as promised and increase those happy hormones, chocolate for example, 70%+ cocoa contains theobromine (which can help boost mood) and phenylethylamine (associated with feelings of love and joy). But happiness doesn’t come from a chemical reaction from one snack, it comes from your body working well.","Problems start from using a one size fits all approach, a diet, a detox, cutting out grains or dairy, only eating raw food. One person might go vegan and have boundless energy, glowing skin and feel amazing but someone else might feel lethargic, lose some hair and the colour from their cheeks. It all depends on what our body and our microbes need and that’s as individual as a fingerprint.","Most of our immune system is located in the large intestine and the trillions of microbes in there are closely linked to our nervous system, they protect against toxins, every substance that your brain uses is made in there and it’s key in hormone production - so our happiness, mood, appetite… all depend on their harmony. It’s an ever-growing area of research but there have even been trials of diets as a treatment for mental health conditions with pretty amazing results.","The fine print on happy foods","The key is keeping it simple, the fewer the processes it’s gone through the better it is for you and your gut – that means full fat rather than diet versions. Sugar is one to watch, 30 years ago a handful of berries would be a sweet treat now it’s everywhere and, in many forms, our microbiome just isn’t adapted to the increased volume of it.","Nobody panic – we have dark chocolate on side and carbohydrates are essential, it’s more the types we eat and the volume. Eat good quality bread and sourdough (that artisan bread is worth the price tag, we promise!), good flour properly milled should be a nutritious product, but modern production methods strip out most of the nutrients in commercial breads and bakes. Get your wholegrains in, they’re harder to digest so will get right down to your large intestine for your microbes to enjoy, mix up your gains and try the lower gluten ones like rye, spelt or gluten free buckwheat.","All the things we’d expect to be on the list are there, but lots of fibre and wholegrains are key, lots of vegetables - organic, so those chemicals don’t pass into your body (check the ‘dirty dozen and clean fifteen’ list to see which retain the most and least pesticide residues), leafy greens, eggs, mushrooms, beans and lentils, oats, a bit of cheese and dairy, meat and game (2-times per week), garlic, oily fish, nuts – especially Brazils, seeds – pumpkin seeds are great, legumes – that includes chickpea hummus, extra virgin olive oil – cold pressed varieties, unpasteurised ferments like kimchi.","On the plus side, studies have also shown that treating yourself to that cake or fried chicken, in moderation is good for you as well - keeping those microbes on their toes keeps them sharp. Variety is the spice of life, good, ‘bad’ and everything in between.","","By Katy McClelland.","Freelance food stylist, recipe developer & food editor specialising in creating recipes for editorial, advertising, TV and film, social media and video content.

Top tips for transforming the most basic spaces","It may be functional, but a utility room can be a fabulous part of your home as well. Interiors and property journalist Sarah Warwick explains how to make yours as good looking as the rest of your rooms.","Colour schemes","A utility room should look clean, be well-lit, and have a calm aura, and the colours you choose for its walls and units are key. The word ‘clean’ probably suggests white, but – just like in the bathroom – use too much of it and the effect can be clinical rather than stylish. ","Instead, consider using white just for the walls, or limiting it to the units. This way, you’ll still enjoy the brightness of light-reflective surfaces and create a pristine feel, but you can introduce a second colour to bring more personality to the utility room. ","Darker shades like deep blues, blacks, or greys are on trend for kitchen cabinetry, so you could repaint units in one of these tones. If the utility room is located just off the kitchen, you might want to match to the units there for a cohesive feel.","Don’t want such a strong contrast? Tonal neutrals for both walls and cabinets can keep the room light filled and create understated contemporary style.","","","Image Credit - Carpetright","Play with pattern","A utility room definitely doesn’t have to be a pattern-free zone just because it’s a hard-working space. Where to introduce it when there are units and appliances all round the walls? The floor provides the perfect opportunity to bring interest to the space using patterned tiles or vinyl.","Both will work in an area where splashes are inevitable, and are easy to clean. Tiles are a classic hard-wearing choice, while luxury vinyl can offer warmth underfoot and be more forgiving of dropped objects.","When it comes to which pattern to opt for, geometrics are a great fit, suiting both older and new homes, and they’re an on-trend choice designers and influencers show no sign of renouncing.","","","Image Credit - Garden Trading","Make essentials a feature","Your utility room is likely a space for washing, drying, and ironing, and even minor clothes repairs could take place there. The kit you need for all these tasks needs to be at hand, but this necessity can actually gain you style points. Instead of shutting everything away, use wall space for attractive shelving that leaves everything ready to grab, plus adds to the room’s élan. ","Think it’s going to look messy? The key is to choose containers that will corral essentials whether they’re for cleaning, sewing or other household jobs, and which look good on show. There are some fabulous purpose-made designs around, but you can think laterally, too. A jug or vase could accommodate some cleaning must-haves, for example. Think materials as well. Woven baskets will add a natural note, metal has a traditional vibe, while wood and earthenware are tactile.","As well as shelves, peg rails or rows of hooks are a practical as well as appealing element for a utility room, accommodating clothes on hangers before and after ironing. They needn’t have classic style either with contemporary and industrial takes available.","","","Image Credit - Porcelain Superstore","Decant and organise","Even the products that keep your clothes and linens clean and their fabrics in optimum condition can make a style statement. Their packaging won’t do the room any favours, but decant them into clear glass or other containers and they can be left on display. Make sure, of course, these are always safely out of the reach of any young kids in your home.","Storing essentials this way will make your laundry tasks quick and efficient, but your appliances have to deliver on these requirements, too, as well as matching up to its good looks. The sleek new Samsung WW9800T washing machine delivers on both counts, reducing washing time to just 39 minutes for a full clean. It even features ecobubble™ technology, which saves heat energy and also protects the colour of clothes.","Snap and share your stylish utility room with #SamsungKX","","By Sarah Warwick","Sarah specialises in homes, interiors, home improvement and property, frequently writing for titles including Real Homes, Ideal Home, The Guardian and Fabulous magazine.","More articles"],"meta":{"icon":"article","tags":[]}},{"id":"lifestyle|guest-writer-of-the-week|18","title":"Guest writer of the week: Build the perfect workout playlist","description":"","image":"https://images.samsung.com/is/image/samsung/p5/uk/explore/kings-cross/home-of-innovation/lifestyle/guest-writer-of-the-week/18/THUMBNAIL.png","category":"lifestyle","url":"/uk/explore/kings-cross/lifestyle/guest-writer-of-the-week/18","values":["Guest writer of the week: Build the perfect workout playlist","","","","Build the perfect workout playlist","It probably seems obvious that music can help you have a better workout – after all, that’s the whole point of Spin studios, and even marathons sometimes have brass bands – but there’s more to hitting a new PB than just cranking up the volume and searching Spotify for Workout Bangers. The science of using music to enhance performance is well-established – and even if you’re not aiming for Olympian heights of achievement, there’s plenty you can do to make your next gym session more productive by just changing your tunes. Here’s how to build a better playlist – that takes you from hype-up to cooldown. ","For your warmup","Going for a big session? The preparation starts before you even hit the gym. In a study of 54 tennis players who were interviewed on their pre-competition listening habits, most listened to music with a BPM of 90 or above, at an average of 87 decibels, to hit the state they described as ‘psyched up’. They also chose music that rated high for ‘familiarity’  – so choose a favourite up-tempo tune when you’re on final approach to the gym to make sure you’re ready to go. ","For a big cardio effort","Time to up the tempo - preferably to roughly match whatever activity you’re doing. According to a 2010 study, music that hits that 120-140BPM sweet spot helped cyclists put in more effort, especially if they liked what they were listening to. Meanwhile, rowers who listened to a fast-tempo excerpt from Beethoven’s 7th symphony were able to go faster than those who listened to a slower section, or nothing at all . ","For a tough session","If you’ve got a mammoth effort planned, keep it upbeat: a 2012 study conducted with elite triathletes at the Queensland Academy of Sport showed that treadmill running to exhaustion was increased by more than 18% when participants ran in time to music that included everything from Oasis to Taylor Swift. Oddly, the effect was slightly more pronounced – going up to 19.7% – when volunteers ran to music that was described as ‘neutral’ rather than ‘motivational’  – so you might not need the Eye Of The Tiger for every single session.","For focus","If you’re doing a more skill-based workout – like practising your gymnastics work on rings, or doing technical Olympic-style lifts like the snatch or clean and jerk – it’s not the time to crank up your dubstep megamix. Slower, more familiar music can help you find your focus – as it did for two-time Olympic gold medalist Dame Kelly Holmes, who used Alicia Keys in her pre-event routine at the Athens Games of 2004, or Audley Harrison, who listened to Japanese classical music en route to his own podium spot.","For your cooldown","Don’t ditch your Galaxy Buds Live after your post-workout shower – they last for up to 21 hours, so there’s no need to be worrying about saving that battery. After your workout, the right music can produce bodily changes that mean you should recover more quickly. Stay tuned in for 20 to 30 minutes of slow, sedate music to lower your body’s levels of the stress hormone cortisol – it can also help you remember your training session more fondly, meaning that you’ll be more likely to want to repeat the experience. Keep it slow-paced and simple, avoiding complex rhythmic structures and jarring transitions – if you can handle some Handel, his classical compositions are ideal.","By Joel Snape.","Joel Snape is a freelance journalist, frequently contributing to titles including the Guardian, the Telegraph and Men’s Fitness.

It makes things easier, more effective and has brought us opportunity, knowledge and access to delicious new foods and recipes.","The internet allows you to find out where things are from and how they are getting to you, as well as whether you can buy it in person or from a local shop. That’s the beauty of it – you can do your research before to help the environment (even with online shopping you can still support your local businesses – they now have the opportunity to reach a wider audience). Sometimes the barrier to being more environmentally friendly can be being limited to what’s available in the shops around you. That might mean ordering your veg box from a farm delivery service, buying home grown grains and fresh milled flour direct from the producers or your meat and dairy delivered from a grass-fed organic farm.","Companies are moving with the times and making effort to be more eco-friendly. Even in appliances, Samsung’s new RB7300 fridge is made to be more efficient by its high-efficiency insulation and ability to preserve the freshness of food by twice as long.","As far as food shopping goes, to waste less and buy produce with as lower environmental impact needs just one thing – planning. Use the time saved by shopping online to think before you buy - check what’s in the kitchen, check use by dates, and plan what you want to cook. A well-stocked store cupboard is the base for easy cooking; spices, preserves, oils, vinegars etc. all give flavour. Store and rework leftovers and refrigerate odds and ends to make into meals for in-between days. Mostly, recipes aren’t set in stone, swap in what you have.

Consider colours like warm orange-red, deep blue or green, or even charcoal. They can all create a backdrop which furniture, lighting and decorative accessories can contrast against to give a fabulous effect.","Worried the room might be too dark? Don’t be! The result can be cosy and cocooning – just what you want from a living room. However, if you prefer, you don’t have to use a dramatic shade all around the room. Try it for the wall behind the sofa, or for even smaller areas such as the rear of shelves for a pop of colour. Shots of both of these could go down a storm on your Insta feed, too.","Work with texture","","Image Credit - Sofa.com","Contrast is key for a living room scheme that’s full of interest, and that doesn’t just mean colour. Think textures as well for a room rich in decorative detail. You might like to set a deep pile rug in front of a smooth velvet sofa or armchair, or you could dress existing seating with woollen, knitted, faux fur or woven throws, or with a selection of cushions in tactile finishes. You could add in a rattan chair or, for a lower budget way to add texture, go for wicker storage baskets.","Different textural finishes make a room pleasing to your eye and sense of touch every day, plus they look great on camera. Rugs for sinking your feet into, interesting knits, strokable fabrics and woven materials along with smooth pieces create plenty to draw the eye to your Insta image.","Think details","","Image Credit - Swoon","For a great living room scheme, consider the smaller elements you’ll take pleasure from when you’re in the space – and that you’ll want to share as vignettes. It might be chic storage furniture, smart shelving, lush houseplants or weird and wonderful succulents, or a special piece for your entertaining space like a luxe drinks station.","Don’t leave it there, though. Arrange decorative accessories to make a stylish grouping on the top of a sideboard or console table, or create a gallery display with artwork hung directly above it. Arrange books by colour or size to grab attention and take a brilliant #shelfie, or show off gorgeous glasses, decanters and a cocktail shaker along with elegant bottles at your drinks station.","Celebrate the season","","Image Credit - Lights4fun.co.uk","With the annual festivities around the corner now, you’ll want to bring Christmas to your living room and share the loveliness on social. Dress up the mantelpiece if you’re lucky enough to have one, or create a display on a side table. A simple grouping of candles of different heights along with seasonal foliage can create atmospheric illumination and makes a great vignette for your feed. ","A sizeable Christmas tree is a must-have if your room has the dimensions, and choosing a single bauble colour or a limited range of shades makes for both impact in the room and on a screen. When you’re shooting, avoid putting the tree dead centre of the photo. Instead, use the rule of thirds: in other words, if you imagine your image divided into three equal parts vertically, your tree will be along one of these lines with other elements of the room scheme shown in the rest of the photo.","To win double taps and followers you’ll also need to make sure your phone can deliver whether you’re planning to post #homeinspo at Christmas or throughout the rest of the year. The Samsung Galaxy S20FE has a triple lens camera, so you can easily pick from wide angle and ultra wide to shoot your room, plus capture the details with the 3x optical zoom on the telephoto camera.

","For instance, rose petals taste sweet and floral and work well in desserts like Turkish delight or almond sponge. As for savoury meals, Middle Eastern dishes that already contain powerful spices are a good match, such as chicken or lamb tagine. ","Or sprinkle a few rose petals onto a salad and watch it go from dull to dazzling in seconds.","Pansies on the other hand are light and crisp in flavour with a slight peppery kick, and best used sparingly as they are more of a decorative element. Or try chamomile, a blossom known to help people sleep, by sprinkling it into hot butter and adding to a bowl of porridge or make chamomile oil for fish dishes. ","A personal favourite among botanicals is lavender. Here is one of my top recipes.","Battered lavender prawn or cauliflower tempura","This recipe works for meat-lovers, vegetarians and vegans, because the core product can be swapped out for pretty much anything. Personally, I like prawns and cauliflower but you can just as easily go with chicken, tofu, broccoli or eggplants, to name but a few.","Like rose, lavender is a pungent blossom so be careful or it may overpower the other ingredients. You can get dried lavender flowers in most supermarkets.","Ingredients (Serves 2-4)","Method","Start by combining your dry ingredients and mix in a bowl, then throw in the egg and oil.","Add the water while whisking – do this in stages to avoid lumps. Once the batter is smooth, it’s done. If it looks a little runny, add more flax seeds or cornstarch to thicken it up.","You should be able to see the lavender seeds in the batter – if these aren’t visible, add another pinch.","Cut or break the meat or vegetables into desired size.","Heat the oil in a medium-sized pan. Once piping hot, use tongs to drop in the main ingredient into the lavender batter. Here’s the most crucial part: let the batter drip off properly before you move the meat/vegetable into the pan. If you don’t, the batter will not stick. It will also be undercooked, because the outside will look crisp while the inside is still gooey.","","Once the main product goes golden brown, flip it to the other side. Top tip: don’t have too many tempuras in the pan at once or you risk them sticking to each other and becoming one big lump.","","Serve with hot chilli or peanut sauce.","","Share your gorgeous dishes","Cooking with flowers is an art, so why not share the photos with others?","The new Samsung Galaxy S21 phone is great for capturing the ultimate 8K cooking shots. You can video record your tempura whilst it’s sizzling in the pan, and then turn your favourite moments into stunning stills.","Don’t forget about drinks","Flowering plants aren’t just great in food, you can also infuse them into cocktails, lemonade and tea, among other beverages.","How to store blossoms","Fresh flowering plants have a very short shelf life – they will wilt after around four to five days (or last up to a week, if you’re lucky). Keep them in an airtight container, lined with a damp paper towel – it will help keep them moist – and store in the fridge. Or go for dried flowers, which are often cheaper.","","","By Almara Abgarian.","Almara is a freelance journalist and broadcaster, frequently writing for the Metro, the Telegraph and Good Housekeeping, and featuring on the Times Radio and BBC Radio London.

One of my most asked questions? Exactly how do they get their clients to look so picture perfect in photographs? Here, I share some of the secrets they've parted with, as well as top tips on capturing flawless shots on the Samsung Galaxy S21 5G.","Be SPF savvy ","There's a common misconception that you should avoid ANY products containing SPF if you're being photographed since the ingredients that reflect the sun's rays (namely, titanium dioxide and zinc oxide) can cause a ghostly white \"flashback\" effect. While this is true to some extent, it's often dependent on the way the formula is blended so don't go sacking off your favourite sun protection-spiked product just yet. One of the most popular foundations amongst bridal makeup artists is MAC Studio Fix Fluid SPF15, £27, that won't conjure up a 'Casper' effect. And remember, flashback only occurs when using a direct flash which isn't particularly flattering anyway. You'll get a much softer effect with natural light so position yourself in front of a window.","Skip a powder faux pas","Who can forget those iconic red carpet snaps of celebrities sporting bright white stripes along their jawline... yep, the wrong application of setting powder can also wreak havoc with your photos and, believe it or not, those dubbed 'HD-friendly' are often the worst offenders. While these powders can be useful for blurring the skin in high definition television work, they often appear stark white under a direct flash. The fix? Steer clear of those with silica on the ingredients list. Laura Mercier Translucent Loose Setting Powder, £32, fits the bill. Mica, found in many sparkly powder highlighters, can also be problematic. Instead cheat luminosity with a touch of L'Oreal Paris Glow Mon Amour Highlighting Drops, £9.99. Concentrate on the high points of your face like your cheekbones, bridge of your nose and your Cupid's bow to prevent your face looking flat and one-dimensional.","Amp up with layers","A gentle smattering of sheer powder blush or eyeshadow looks beautiful in real life but doesn't always translate in pictures. For added oomph and colour on camera, makeup artists layer cream formulas underneath powder first. Charlotte Tilbury Eyes to Mesmerise Cream Eyeshadows, £22 each, come in shades to make every eye colour smoulder while you can't beat Glossier Cloud Paints, £15 each, for cheeks.","","Check your neck","When your shoulders, neck or décolletage are likely to be in shot, too, it's worth doing a little perfecting so you're not mismatched. To diffuse marks or redness, pop on the tinted Vita Liberata Body Blur Instant HD Skin Finish, £29.95 – a favourite with the Victoria's Secret models, it works like a real life filter for the body. I've even seen makeup artists apply highlighter to their clients' knuckles when their hands are set to be pictured. Excessive? Maybe, although I have been known to mix a dot of foundation with my hand cream to fake hand model-worthy mitts in a flash...","Shooting on the Samsung Galaxy S21 5G","","Beauty work done, it's time to get snapping – the easy bit, thanks to the state-of-the-art new Samsung Galaxy S21 5G. If you're tired of taking countless different shots then follow these simple steps;","And that's not all. You can even grab crystal clear images from 8K video content.

The only problem? This means that there are going to be times you should work out when you don’t really want to: when it’s too cold, too hard, or you’re just too tired. The solution: have a handful of ready-made fixes on hand to get yourself ready to go, and fire them up when you need a jolt. Here’s how.","Just plan to do one thing well","There’s a Catch-22 to training: the more you’re trying to tackle, the more intimidating it is. If you’re aiming to hit your muscles from half a dozen angles every workout – maybe with a bit of fat loss on the side – you’re probably committing to an hour or so of training, making it easy to cop out early or scrap the whole thing. Instead, do a quick warmup and then do the one or two moves you know will give you the biggest bang for your buck. A classic example? Do as many press-ups as you can, rest for two minutes, then do 50% of your max every minute, for five minutes. You’ll tax your muscles and lay the groundwork for improvement, without burning your willpower or sacrificing a huge chunk of your day.","Fire up your nervous system","A good warmup doesn’t just get your body warm and your heart pumping: it should also fire up your CNS (central nervous system) to let you recruit maximal muscle fibres for whatever you’re doing — so a handful of stretches and a couple of squats won’t cut it. Instead, skip for a minute – this’ll also help your coordination – then either do high knees on the spot for 10 seconds, or jump squats for the same amount of time. You’ll finish with a new spring in your step.","Block everything out with music","There are plenty of studies showing that music can help you put in more effort in a workout, but there’s increasing evidence that it can also aid focus and concentration – if you pick the right tunes. The theory is that we have two attention systems: a conscious one that enables us to direct our focus towards whatever we’re actually concentrating on and an unconscious one that shifts attention towards anything our senses pick up that might be significant. Music – preferably slightly syncopated[1] but not too manic – can help block out unnecessary sources of the latter, making noise-cancelling headphones an ideal way to stay focused. The Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro are great for this, they have Intelligent Active Noise Control[2] meaning you can switch from pure noise cancellation (which cuts out up to 99% of background noise) to Ambient Mode[3] , which allows you to amplify nearby sounds by 20 decibels. Perfect for whether you’re running outside or doing a quick workout at home.","[1] https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0094446","[2] Compatible Android device and Galaxy Wearable app required - Android 7.0 or higher & RAM 1.5GB above","[3] Control of Ambient Mode only compatible with an Android device - Android 7.0 or higher & RAM 1.5GB above. Galaxy Wearable app required.","galaxy buds pro","Have a coffee","Pre-workout supplements can work, but there’s a simpler way to get a boost before you train – coffee has proven workout-boosting benefits, and doesn’t come with any of the unwanted extras you might find in less proven powders. The key is when to take your shot. Studies suggest[4] that coffee starts to take effect around 10 minutes after you drink, but peaks in effectiveness 45 minutes after it enters your system – so if you down an espresso half an hour before you plan to train, you’ll be feeling the buzz just as your workout gets into high gear. Remember, though - caffeine can dehydrate you, so it’s worth chugging a glass of water alongside your brew.","[4]   https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/12/081222113526.htm","coffee","…And change the way you think","Picture the scene: it’s raining outside, you’ve got a load of work to do, a new season of Brooklyn 99 just hit Netflix...and it’s a workout day. What you tell yourself next matters, according to several studies conducted by researchers investigating the effects of language on sticking to ‘goal directed’ behaviour. Say ‘I can’t miss this workout’ and you’re setting yourself up for a fall - you’re putting an external restriction on yourself and undermining your own agencies. Say ‘I don’t miss workouts’ and you’re making a decision - framing yourself as the sort of person who goes at it whatever the weather – so you’ll find it easier to train not just that day, but every day.","It probably seems obvious that music can help you have a better workout – after all, that’s the whole point of Spin studios, and even marathons sometimes have brass bands – but there’s more to hitting a new PB than just cranking up the volume and searching Spotify for Workout Bangers. The science of using music to enhance performance is well-established – and even if you’re not aiming for Olympian heights of achievement, there’s plenty you can do to make your next gym session more productive by just changing your tunes. Here’s how to build the perfect workout playlist – that takes you from hype-up to cooldown. And as mentioned, if you want to be fully immersed in your soundtrack, then get your hands on the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro – with an 11-millimeter woofer for deeper bass and a 6.5-millimeter tweeter for a crisp treble, the sound is unbeatable.","","By Joel Snape.","Joel Snape is a freelance journalist, frequently contributing to titles including the Guardian, the Telegraph and Men’s Fitness.

Most of us struggle to be selective with our shots, so remain grateful to the digital age and technology’s innovations. Thanks to our smartphones and digital cameras, we’re constantly snapping away, getting every possible angle of a particular shot. Is anyone else guilty of taking the same photo of the sunset one hundred times? Just to capture the ever so slight change in dreamy orange or pink.","The first step in creating a digital scrapbook is to filter and favourite the images you wish to include within the Gallery app – you can even create your own digital album to store your favourites within. The sunset definitely should be one of them…but perhaps not all one hundred times. Although, it depends on the concept you’re pursuing, as an ‘ode to a sunset’ could end up looking really cool across two pages. The world is your oyster when it comes to how many images you wish to include, however cutting down the list will just make the editing process a lot swifter as there will be less photos to fine-tune.","As a rule of thumb, it would be nice to get a selection of scenery, city shots and pictures with you, partners, family and friends (should you have travelled with any). Or, if a food-focused travel scrapbook, then a selection of dishes from restaurants, cafes, and street vendors is perfect. Like we said, you’re the creative director.","","Apps and Editing Software","Relive your best travel memories as you flick through them, selecting the top tier for editing. Enhance, tune, crop and much more via a variety of editing apps and software, in order to create your final images. We’ve all been there: we want the grass to be a bit greener; the blue in the sky to pop a little more; that annoying person who decided to photo bomb your picture to be removed - it’s all possible in post-production. Whether you’re into professional editing software such as Photoshop, Lightroom and Premiere Pro or more mobile-friendly options like the inbuilt Samsung Photo Editor - get your photos into prime position for when you start scrapbooking.","Not only is the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 packed with tools to encourage your creative flow, the large screen makes editing and organising all of your images a lot easier. With cutting-edge features, all of which are seamlessly integrated into the Galaxy ecosystem, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 has been designed for creative activities just like these. Featuring a new and improved S pen and an entire suite of apps and functions perfect for aiding you in your creative outlet, the tablet is your digital canvas.","In addition to the vast number of apps you can download, there’s also the popular drawing app Clip Studio Paint which is ideal for digital creatives. All users can enjoy a six-month free trial of the premium version: Clip Studio Paint EX, allowing Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 holders to access advanced design features and much more.","Decorative Details","Half the fun of creating a physical scrapbook is getting inventive with fonts, textures and other decorative details. A trip to Hobbycraft or another arts and crafts store is essential in getting fully stuck into your latest project.","This kind of fun can be extended for when making your digital scrapbook too, as you can import (or create your own) graphic files to emulate lettering, stickers and elements such as stitching or tape markings. Once you have your software and supplies, you can start creating your page, incorporating these files within your actual photos. Think how you would when creating a physical scrapbook: for example, you might start with a patterned paper background, before adding your photos on top and then decorating with bows, stitching and frames. You can use text tools to create captions or little notes to attach to the photos, explaining the story behind them or something funny that happened during that moment.","Compilation Process","If you’re using Adobe Photoshop to create your digital scrapbook, you’re going to need to start off by making a template. If you have any plans to print this digital scrapbook at a later date, the ideal resolution to select would be something around 300.","Next is the fun part: gather all your imagery and assets and get thinking about the theme of your scrapbook. Import whatever asset you wish to use as your background and then you can get started on image positioning per page. Photoshop allows you to play around with effects and shadows, to make your digital scrapbook seem as real-life and professional as possible. You can then go ahead and add things like frames, borders and other decorative elements, as well as layering other textures and backgrounds on different parts of the page - as you might do with a physical scrapbook.","","By Amira Arasteh.","Amira is a freelance lifestyle journalist, frequently writing for the likes of Stylist, Refinery 29 and Time Out.

But it's the chunky chains and super-size pendants that are set to really dominate the high street this season.","And Other Stories' designs start from around £17 or check out independent brand SEOL + GOLD, from £189.95.

Anthropologie's satin selection, in muted browns and beiges, will make the simplest of outfits infinitely cooler.","Sometimes getting the perfect selfie is hard… especially when the back of your hair is the focus! The Single Take feature of the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G is genius for this – tap the shutter once and move around for up to ten seconds.

You spend half the morning wishing the time away only to be faced with a meal scoffed in five minutes and the remaining allotted time spent mooching about the office (or house, depending on your current predicament) in search of some source of entertainment. Well, if it’s a midday thrill you seek, our top-pick of lunchtime watches will whet your appetite more than your dismal cheese sarnie.","WandaVision","Streaming on Disney+ ","","IMAGE: ©2021 MARVEL","WandaVison is the ideal lunch-time filler (averaging at just under half an hour per episode), so there’s enough time to prep your lunch and still fit in an episode or two. Convenient, yes, but that’s not the only reason it’s made the list. This whimsical (if not slightly unnerving) addition to the Marvel Universe is suitable for both fans and newcomers alike. Though it clearly follows the events of Box Office smash hit - Avengers Endgame - it doesn’t demand background knowledge from the viewers, holding enjoyment to ransom until you’ve caught up. Instead, we find protagonists Wanda Maximoff and husband Vision trying to navigate a normal suburban life despite being anything but normal (she an enhanced being, him a synthezoid humanoid - basically an android composed of synthetic human organs and functions). The two get into many hijinks, however despite their comical conundrums there is an air of something sinister afoot. Something evil threatens their happiness, but what’s lurking is something you’ll have to watch to find out.","Of course, WandaVision is a spinoff from the MCU franchise and so has high-quality visual effects you would expect from any Marvel movie (thank you Disney). The transition from big to small screen feels seamless. However, if you’re a movie buff craving that extra premium experience from the home Samsung’s Neo QLED 8K TV is a MUST. It’s Edge-to-edge viewing with the Infinity One Design offers an almost bezel-less screen creating an even more immersive viewing experience. The Quantum Technology Matrix Pro will also lend itself well to the insanely glorious, special effects when Wanda’s powers really come into show.

It’s absolutely criminal that this mini-series only has five episodes but thankfully it’ll set you up quite nicely for your Monday to Friday lunchtime viewing. The show follows a group of five friends comprised of four gay men and their best girlfriend in the 80s. Expect fun, laughter and passion as they journey through life following their dreams. However, despite the captivating humour, reality seeps as illness ravishes the gay community. Set against the backdrop of the AIDs pandemic of the 80s the clique embodies a reality that many had to face and their trials will leave you truly touched.","","Teen First Dates","Streaming on All 4","","IMAGE: Channel 4 / Dave King","A palate cleanser to the heavier It’s a Sin, First Dates is back with a new series and it’s just as entertaining as it ever was.

Cringe-worthy, awkward encounters as singletons fumble their way to love (or not) makes for easy, comedy. The ideal way to while away that hour.","","Behind Her Eyes","Streaming on Netflix ","","IMAGE: Netflix","Ever find yourself drifting off at the screen? Behind Her Eyes is set to be a watch that’ll keep you thoroughly alert. Based on the bestselling novel, creator Steve Lightfoot takes novelist Sarah Pinborough’s psychological thriller and brings it to a screen near you.  Duplicity sits at the core of this watch as single mother Louise begins an affair with her psychiatrist boss whilst striking up a friendship with his wife, however as the twisted mind games unfold, nothing is what it seems. The teaser trailer hints at a nail-biter that will have you at the edge of your seat…couch…bed, basically, where ever you’re perched you’ll be at the edge.","As an added bonus the object tracking sound pro in the Samsung Neo QLED 8K TV will really help to immerse you in the chilling nature of some of the scenes.

In 2021, more studies support the use of gaming as a therapeutic tool than ever before, and some prove it’s on par with more traditional hobbies and pastimes like binging your favourite shows or losing yourself in a good book. People that play games – particularly people that play games collaboratively – typically report greater mental wellbeing than those that don’t.","Gaming, like any hobby, gets better and more effective as a tool for relaxation as you commit more time and resources to it. Games have the power to transport you unlike anything else – thanks to the mentally active, engaging nature of gaming, video games tend to bring you into the world as a more active agent, not as a passive observer. As such, it’s not just easy to lose hours in a given fantasy world… it’s almost essential if you want to enjoy a brief, virtual holiday from the stresses and anxieties of the real world.","[1] https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/nov/16/video-gaming-can-benefit-mental-health-find-oxford-academics","Why escapism is so important","Escapism is a psychological phenomenon that happens when your brain goes into a different state, and it can be good for you[2]. During 2020, when the world was learning to socialise at a distance thanks to the lockdowns, video games became a respected and essential tool for anyone eager to resume a somewhat normal life. Even the World Health Organisation encouraged people to engage with more video game content[3] in order to help offset the effects of isolation and loneliness during the worst of the lockdown. The power of immersion is recognised by medical experts the world over then, and games that help immerse the player – you – are demonstrably good for your health.","Games like Animal Crossing: New Horizons (Nintendo Switch) can be a relaxing ‘home away from home’ Source: Dom Peppiatt / Nintendo","","Depending on the sort of player you are, you’re going to respond to different games differently – everyone is different when it comes to video game immersion, after all. Some players are liable to suspend disbelief and engage with another world if the graphics are more photorealistic, say. Other players may become more immersed in a game world that features characters that are more like them in personality or appearance. It depends on a players’ personal preference in games when it comes down to what works better for the individual player. Whether you can sink hours into the cutesy, easy-going island life simulator of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, or prefer the pseudo-realistic mechanics and world of Red Dead Redemption 2, there’s a game out there that has the potential to ease you through hundreds of hours of calm, focused gaming time if you let it.","[2] https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/collections/201207/when-escapism-is-good[3] https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/coronavirus-world-health-organisation-play-games-covid-19-advice-a9438916.html","The power of immersion","There are many factors that influence immersion when it comes to videogames – rewards, gameplay loops, difficulty, flow – but one of the most powerful tools for helping gamers lose themselves in a virtual world is graphical fidelity. Tech is catching up with gamers’ desires to lose themselves fully in virtual worlds: virtual reality is the most notable aspect of this, and doctors around the globe are already in the process of using VR headsets for therapeutic and medical reasons[4].","VR can be good for immersion and escapism, but it’s often a resource-heavy solution for the average gamer. Source: Samsung","","If you don’t have the space to invest in a full-scale VR setup in order to transport you to your virtual world of choice, you could opt instead for a more immersive monitor than the standard one you likely perform your day-to-day tasks on. The Samsung G9 monitor, for instance, has been specifically designed to match the contours of the human eye to better engage players that are sitting at their battlestations for extended periods of time, making for better comfort and heightened realism. QLED, HDR1000, and DQHD resolution also combine to create a visual profile that’s just as realistic and immersive as a VR headset – yet without the excessive cables, price and setup.","It’s largely agreed that Rockstar’s Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of the most immersive and complete games of all time. Source: Rockstar","","If you’re more eager than ever to experience the world of your gaming hero – whether that’s Aloy from Horizon Zero Dawn, Arthur from Red Dead Redemption 2 or any of the gung-ho soldiers from the Call of Duty series – having a curved monitor fill even the peripherals of your vision and keep you engaged and locked into the story for longer is only ever going to be a good thing.","[4] https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/virtual-reality-and-the-covid-mental-health-crisis/","Games are good for you","Long gone are the days where the general consensus was that gaming is a negative thing, where it was assumed that people that spend time playing video games are maladjusted or unwell. Current data suggests that just 0.3% of gamers might experience problems controlling the time they spend playing video games[5] – and it’s largely thanks to better tech and utilities in the gaming industry that players are experiencing better health. Even something as seemingly minor as the HDR1000 and HDR10+ brightness capabilities of the Samsung G9 monitor can help prevent eye strain during longer play sessions, proving that tech is quickly catching up with the needs and habits of the modern gamer.","Now, people from all walks of life are experimenting with gaming as an outlet for the stresses they deal with ‘IRL’, and gaming time has become as common as going to the movies or playing sports as a way of relaxing or chilling out with friends. If you’re going to spend more time escaping into virtual worlds, you owe it to yourself to use the best tools possible to make your rejuvenation time as enjoyable and engaging as possible.","[5] https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/people/andrew-przybylski/","","Dom Peppiatt is a veteran video games critic and consultant copywriter that has appeared in publications ranging from Daily Star to The Guardian.

Don’t forget to snap your #StayingIn look and share with #SamsungKX.","Brilliant Base","There’s no need to slather on heavy makeup all the time, it’s important to give your skin a bit of breathing space. If you’ve been the victim of stressed-skin breakouts and looking for some coverage, a tinted moisturiser should be your go-to. The perfect hybrid of makeup and skincare, it offers a dose of light coverage and a boost of hydration too. I rate Bare Minerals Complexion Rescue Tinted Moisturiser (£30, bareminerals.co.uk) for a healthy-looking glow. Available in 20 shades, it’s super refreshing with buildable coverage, helping to cater to your own complexion. It’s comfortable on the skin, and a lightweight alternative for working-from-home days. What’s more, it also has SPF30 – so it’ll protect you both when inside or outdoors.","Cool Coverage","Stayed up late completing a TV series? Screens are not so forgiving on the skin so a dash of concealer will help refresh your peepers. Infused with light-diffusing micropearls NYX’s Born to Glow Radiant Concealer (£9, nyxcosmetics.co.uk) brightens the under-eye area. It also blurs imperfections and covers up blemishes. The built-in puff application makes blending a breeze too, and it’s vegan-friendly.","Flirty Flush","Want a #StayingIn selfie? A pop of blusher will add some warmth to your cheeks if the lighting is a bit harsh. A creamy formula, rather than a powder, melts into skin effortlessly and gives off a natural, dewy finish. I love Maybelline Cheek Heat Blusher in Fuschia Spark (£8.99, Superdrug). The water-based gel cream glides on and can easily be toned up or down, depending on your mood. A little goes a long way too – just one or two dots needed and use your fingers to blend onto skin.","Fabulous Flutter","A swipe of mascara will add definition to your eyes and make them appear brighter on camera. Samsung’s Galaxy S20 has a front facing camera with 40 megapixels so it’s extra good quality for video calls, meaning you’ll want to make the effort. Rimmel’s Scandaleyes Volume on Demand (£7.99, Amazon) is super adaptable, allowing you to control however big you want your lashes. The clump-free formula offers buildable volume so you can reapply throughout the day. Perfect if you want to slip on a layer for your 9am video conference and then reapply in the evening for a call with friends.","Pucker up","Testing the water with a virtual date? Nothing lifts a look more than a colour-popping pout and since there’s no chance of a kiss, you can totally risk it. Plus, if you’re anxious about the lack of foundation on your skin, an attention-grabbing lippie will keep the focus firmly on your luscious lips. If you can’t be faffed with the upkeep of a lipstick, a lip stain is low maintenance with high impact. As the name suggests, the colour will stay put so you won’t lose it to your wine glass or have to dash off to the loo to reapply. L’Oréal Paris Brilliant Signature in Be Brilliant (£10.99, Superdrug) gives a high-shine finish with no stickiness.","Hair Hero","Amika’s Perk Up Dry Shampoo (£20, BeautyBay.com) is my saviour, helping tresses look and feel fresh when they are far from it. The talc-free formula absorbs oil without leaving a white residue. Plus, it smells DIVINE and the packaging looks super fun and colourful on my bathroom shelf.","My final tip would be to spritz on a bit of your favourite perfume because although you can’t sniff through a screen, a whiff of that familiar scent is guaranteed to give you an extra boost of confidence, especially if you’re about to embark on a virtual date.

The six-part series is told from the perspective of the love-hungry, geeky microbiology student Amina Hussain (Anjana Vasan) as she becomes embroiled in the world of punk music after joining a band. We are Lady Parts opens her up to exciting new experiences that are starkly different from her day-to-day life and she finds herself torn between the two lifestyles. The show appears to have a sarcastic, frank and dry comedy appeal. For maximum viewing enjoyment there’s no better pick than the Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 360.  It’s Super AMOLED display makes colours brighter and more vivid, this, coupled with the superb sound quality from the Dolby Atmos support make for a supreme viewing experience that goes hand in hand with those music scenes.

Relatable and endearing, it’s the ideal comedy for your commute.","Never Have I Ever","Source: Isabella B. Vosmikova / NetflixStreaming on Netflix ","","Now is the perfect time to catch up on this gem as the new series is set to be released July 2021. Very much a teen comedy with an all-age appeal, the show takes you back to those awkward days of being a misfit, trying to figure out who you were and dating – the early years (did your insides just recoil?) and if that was never you then – quite frankly – you can’t sit with us. Girlfriends Devi, Fabiola and Eleanor (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, Lee Rodriguez and Ramona Young respectively) set about climbing the high-school social ladder by ‘rebranding’ and make a tremendously cringe-worthy hash of it along the way. It’s themes of grief and loss add heart but there are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments to be found in this watch so embrace your inner teen and get streaming. However, if being a grown-up obsessed with teen comedies gives you a deep sense of chagrin then the Samsung Galaxy Pro 360 definitely has your back. Its built-in Secret Screen’ function makes it difficult for your fellow commuters to see the content from other angles.

When the show starts, we find Issa Dee (aka Rae) entering the last year of her 20s as a quirky, insecure woman in a bit of a rut and struggling with her sense of identity. Much like 15-year-old Devi from Never Have I Ever, she is desperate to rebrand. The show explores the black female perspective and deals with some real issues in a way that hits home whilst keeping you in stitches. Insecure is available to watch now, with season 5 premiering later this year so a binge catch-up is a MUST.","Bloods","Source: SkyStreaming on Sky 1 and Now TV","","With a release date of the 5th May comedy fans will have to wait just a little bit longer to start this watch but if the show is anything like the trailer, it’ll be worth it. An unlikely friendship is formed between Samson Kayo and Jane Horrocks’ characters divorcee Wendy and cool-guy Maleek when the two paramedics are paired together on the job. Expect plenty of cringy over-sharing, straight talking and banter against the backdrop of real-life 999 emergency situations in this six-part comedy series.","Being super lightweight, the Galaxy Book Pro 360 is the perfect on-the-go companion for nimbly nipping between train platforms or zipping on and off buses which means minimal disturbance for you as you fly through those lost seasons.

However, this is also the room that is often neglected when it comes to interior design. Journalist and former chef Almara Abgarian – who is currently renovating her own kitchen – is here to help with some simple but effective tips on how to give new life to this important space.","Make a mood board","Start by creating a mood board, it will help ensure that the kitchen has a cohesive theme. Then, do your research. Interior terms can often seem scary but they’re actually very helpful. Not sure what your style is? Read product descriptions of existing products in your home to find out what you’re drawn to or have a scroll through Pinterest for inspiration. Then, ask yourself what you need from your kitchen. Is it intended as a social space for entertaining friends? How important is style versus practicality? Does it need to be family-friendly and child-proof? Don’t be afraid to experiment but make conscious choices.","Personalisation is everything","Many people think it’s difficult or expensive to replace existing features in a kitchen, but nothing could be further from the truth. First up, tackle the cupboards; consider painting these in a new shade or add new handles to spruce up an otherwise ‘generic’ look. If you have nice crockery, consider removing the cupboards completely and replacing these with budget-friendly shelves to showcase the collection. Personally, I keep my wooden cutting boards on hooks next to my cupboard, partly because I like them on display, but I also use these a lot – and this provides easy access.","Next up: the white goods","Don’t just accept whatever your home came with. After all, you open the fridge at least a few times per day, so why not make sure it’s pretty to look at, too? White is so last year. As an example, Samsung’s Bespoke refrigerator is fully customisable and comes in 20 different colours, including pastel shades and seven finishes, like the luxurious Champagne Rose Steel. You can even choose multiple colours for one fridge – like having sky blue top doors and a lavender freezer door, perhaps. It’s guaranteed to set your kitchen apart from the rest.","The devil is in the details","Once you’re happy with the ‘big stuff’, it’s time for details – and these are very cheap to add but make a big difference. Consider buying plants, paintings or freestanding features like a wine rack, a rustic shelf for dry goods or maybe just a fruit bowl. Pour oil into fancy bottles, replace ageing utensils and add an accent rug. You could change the backsplash too by adding peel-and-stick tiles in an unusual pattern or painting the grout from white to black. Small changes can transform a kitchen in minutes.","","It’s the inside that counts","OK this rule isn’t entirely true… but the inside is very important.Consider this: you open the cupboard and find plates and glasses in disarray, nothing is where it should be and cooking no longer feels like fun, but like effort. Throw out goods that take up unnecessary space and buy containers for ingredients that you use often. Don’t keep non-perishable goods that you bought ages ago; if it’s not going to get eaten, donate it to a neighbour or a food bank. It may seem like a small thing but not seeing that old tin of tuna every time you reach for something else will bring you peace of mind, trust me. I like glass containers with cork lids for my coffee, pasta and rice – as it lets me see when I am running low. But it also looks stylish; I put these containers on my kitchen counter to act as a decoration on their own. The same goes for the fridge and freezer. For instance, add a rack for wine, beer, or even beauty products - the Samsung Bespoke refrigerator provides modular storage options for all of your needs. Food safety is also key. Label dishes and ingredients and keep raw meats in separate bags.","Embrace technology","Make technology work for you. Add a speaker system (I highly recommend dancing in the kitchen while cooking), keep a phone charger on hand and invest in a decent kettle or espresso machine.You can also go high tech by adding features such as the Samsung SmartThings Cooking, which lets you manage meal plans, store recipes and keep a fridge inventory. What’s more, it also connects to other Samsung appliances.","Don’t forget the lighting but bear in mind: kitchen light needs to be both functional and atmospheric.If you have access to a lot of natural light, utilise it (avoid thick curtains or drapes). If you don’t, get under-cupboard lights or LED strips for working spaces.

This is perhaps the most compact of travelling spaces - yet people are still jumping on the #vanlife trend. Nevertheless, we’re still a technology-dependent generation and most people want to stay connected whilst on the road. Travel journalist Amira Arasteh shows you how to optimise the use of your gadgets to create and edit content remotely.","","There’s something exhilarating and liberating about packing your bags in a van and driving off into the distance, switching up your route and itinerary whenever you want. A staycation is not to be thought of as restricting, but as an opportunity to see the beauty the UK has to offer. With all these picturesque scenes, there will definitely be Instagrammable moments and memories to blog about - it’s the ultimate opportunity to get some #content. But with such little space available, how do you create an on-the-road office or editing suite in the most optimal fashion?","2 in 1 design","When you geek out on gadgets, it’s quite hard to decide which ones are coming travelling with you. Most of us find ourselves having to choose between devices but the Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 360 offers a 2-in-1 solution. Both a laptop and a tablet, you can optimise your compact workspace on-the-go - without sacrificing space or quality. There’s no need to worry about storage space either as the Galaxy Book Pro 360 comes with additional storage slots - saving and maintaining your files has never been easier.","Small and compact wins the race","Normally when going on a trip, people want to leave their laptops at home - bulk is never best. However, the Galaxy Book Pro 360 is our thinnest and lightest laptop yet and despite its smartphone-like mobility, you don’t have to worry about its lack of durability. The laptop/tablet is tough with military-grade durability. You can fit this into your bag easily and not have it take up too much space in the camper van when you unpack your belongings.","Upload and edit in your own time","One of the problems with bringing gadgets on the go is that as brilliant as technology is, we are restricted to the battery life of our tools. You’ve spent all day taking photographs and now it’s time to edit and then upload your content. Thanks to the long-lasting, fast-charging battery, your Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 360 will stay powered up so you can get on with your work from start to finish, without worrying about the dreaded low battery sign. What’s more, it comes with a pocket-sized USB-C fast charger, so you’ll never be caught out.","Stay connected across devices","","We’re so used to having our various gadgets at our disposal - laptop, phone, tablet. Everything is just there. This changes when you embark upon a trip as it becomes notoriously difficult to get everything packed in a bag for your camper van living quarters. But thanks to the Samsung ecosystem, you can create on-the-go using other Samsung devices to support your work. It’s never been easier to pair your devices together. Pair your Galaxy Book Pro 360 and Galaxy Buds by simply opening the case near your laptop and you’re ready to go. This is particularly useful when you need to avoid disturbing your travelling companion.","Movie night","The AMOLED display on the Galaxy Book Pro 360 offers up the same vivid colours, contrast, and responsiveness as your Galaxy phone’s display. This is great for those days when you need entertaining whilst the weather is temperamental or you simply fancy a little screen time, as you can play games and watch movies with ease. It also has a less harmful blue light so you can do all of this without worrying about straining your eyes.","","By Amira Arasteh.","Amira is a freelance lifestyle journalist, frequently writing for the likes of Stylist, Refinery 29 and Time Out.

Interiors and design journalist Amy Moorea Wong shares five ways to add some pastel prettiness to your home.","Fresh fabrics","If you’re new to having pale colours in the home, begin with something simple. Small accessories such as cushions and throws are a good place to start when changing the look of your home as they make a big change with minimal effort and can quickly be swapped when your taste changes. If you’re feeling a little braver, try small pieces of upholstered furniture dining chairs, stools or poufs for a bigger impact that can still be repositioned easily.","Try placing multiple objects in the same pastel colour around the room, spreading the tones in a minimal-yet-memorable way.","In the frame - pastels as art","An easy way to make a statement with pastels is with artwork. Keep the subject simple – abstract, minimal shapes work well – and let the soft colours be the focus. A block of pastel colours hung on (or propped against) the wall will add a sense of serenity into the room. For an affordable alternative to original artworks, try framing artist prints and posters, or even creating a gallery wall of multiple small frames with different pastel-coloured pieces within.","pastel coloured painting above a fireplace","Image credit Mintstudio at The Poster Club 1","In full bloom - houseplants and pastels","From pink spring blossom to delicate yellow daffodils and blue hydrangea, chalky colours are most often found in the world of nature. Pairing a pastel with greenery at home is an easy way to inject life and colour into your houseplants, even when they’re not in bloom. Choose a pastel coloured pot, planter or hanging basket to make a calming, happy display in even the smallest of rooms or outdoor spaces, and enjoy the soothing benefit of not only your plants themselves (which make us feel grounded and reduce stress), but how they’re on show.","pastel coloured planter with a plant","Image credit Ferm Living","On the wall - picking up the paints","Painting a wall doesn’t have to be a scary prospect. Step outside of your comfort zone and dedicate a weekend to changing the whole feel of a room just with a tin, a brush and a roller. Try these painting-with-pastel tips to ensure it’s a fun and easy process.","- Cover the wall with a primer before applying paint to make sure the paint finish is even. This is especially important with pale colours such as pastels","- Paint the skirting board in the same colour as the wall, so the wall looks longer, and the ceiling seems higher","- Pastel colours reflect light, so are a great way to brighten a dark room when you don’t want to use white","- For a more adventurous look, pair a pale painted wall with another tonal colour to add edge to the pastel","Remember – painted walls can easily be repainted, so don’t feel that your colour choices are for life","A passion for pattern - pastels in tiles and wallpaper","Pastels work brilliantly when combined with similar chalky tones. For a more decorative alternative to painting, wallpaper and tiles are a bold way to add pattern and texture to a space. With pastels, go for a wallpaper design or collection of tiles that combines multiple tones for a joyful look that’s still calming, thanks to the gentle palette. Display the patterned pastel wallpaper or tiles over as large an area as you can, for maximum impact.","Make sure to keep tiles in non-wet areas as they can pick up dust easily.

Some days you just need that extra time in bed, and others you might find yourself choosing to do anything but that run. You spend more time and energy looking for a workout kit, and by the time it’s ready to get out the door, you’ve convinced yourself not to go.","It’s happened to the best of us. If you’re still feeling that guilt of skipping an online class or daily walk to flex your TV-viewing muscles instead, you can still get a good sweat on away from the gym floor.","Okay, so working out from home isn’t some new fitness fad. Sometimes though, you might need to switch things up to make up for the lack of space or motivation from an already chiselled instructor barking at you to get down and give 40 seconds of burpees.","There are some really simple ways to make workouts better suited to your home setup, allowing you to train on your own terms where nobody’s going to judge you for wearing pyjama bottoms or an odd pair of sport socks.","Forget steps, think about your heart","We’ve had it drilled into us over the years that it’s all about getting those steps in. But when space to exercise is more limited or you don’t have stairs to run up and down, ramping up daily step counts is more challenging.","Try shifting the focus onto your heart and looking for training routines that are geared towards raising the heart rate for short bursts. This kind of high intensity interval training is an effective way to burn calories and you don’t have to spend hours doing the workouts to feel the sweaty benefits either.","The Samsung Galaxy Watch takes a bit of the hard work out of finding exercises which raise the heart rate. Try a burpees test or take on the mountain climber’s routines to really get the pulse racing. Start out with some small sets and reps and when you’re feeling more confident, increase things gradually to give the body and heart a tougher session. Want a bit of a competition? Share on Instagram with #SamsungKX, and tag five friends, challenging them to repeat your workout in a shorter time period.","Try some Tabata","Staying on that hearty theme, it’s good to step out of your comfort zone and try something new. That said, it’s equally fine to stick to a familiar routine, especially if you want to make monitoring your progress over time easier.","Sometimes though, you might find that a routine or workout you thought you’d hate actually works well for you. Tabata is a form of high intensity interval training, which features exercises that last just four minutes.","The idea is to work out hard for 20 seconds, rest for 10 seconds and repeat for 8 rounds. Now that doesn’t sound like a long time, but with the right exercises you will feel it.","A quick web browse will find you the best Tabata exercises then try downloading the Tabata Timer on the Samsung Galaxy Watch, which can help you keep track of the short, but intense session.","Move to the music","Music always makes things better. Especially exercise. Some like to keep things high tempo, but what really matters is the kind of playlists that motivate you through no matter how horrendously difficult that session feels.","Take the time to build a few playlists, whether that’s from your own music or turning to your go-to streaming service. If you’re the kind of the person that will spend hours on this, you can use a simple online streaming app which let its algorithms go to work, building you a playlist curated from your favourite songs.","Work out the mind","Meditation before or after putting your body through real pain has huge benefits. Pre-workout, it can help you to relax and get you focused for the session. When you’re done, it can help to cool you down and get that body back to a calmer state before you jump in the shower.","Calm makes one of the best meditation apps to get you in the right frame of mind and it works nicely with the Samsung Galaxy Watch too. It also tracks stress levels to let you know if the programs are having the desired effect of keeping you, well, calm.","By Mike Sawh","Mike Sawh is a freelance journalist covering wearable tech and fitness for the likes of GQ, Wired and Wareable.

All dishes are placed on top of a white wooden table.","Bring the taste of your favourite restaurant home","From simple tweaks to new techniques, food writer, Katy McClelland shows it’s easier than you think to get chef standard food from your own kitchen. Try cooking up one of the recipes below and share your finished dishes with #SamsungKX.","Flavour factor","The easiest way to add amazing flavour is using good ingredients; the better the produce the less effort required. Your shopping doesn’t need to be break the bank but splurging on some things will make a huge difference to the final dish.","Meat and fish are the obvious - you’ll see less shrinkage from cooking and thicker tastier cooking juices from the good stuff (grass fed is also something to look out for with beef). Vegetables in season and from smaller, local producers will also have twice the flavour.","Chefs also add richer flavour with fats. Try making browned butter to elevate your dishes. Use a sauté/ saucepan (a decent size for the amount of butter so it’s not overcrowded), cut the butter into fairly even small cubes. Melt and bubble over a medium high heat, then once it foams and bubbles, let it carry on fairly vigorously for around 5 mins (this is the water evaporating off and the solid fats sizzling and toasting). It should smell biscuit-ty and the bits at the bottom should be deep golden brown – not burnt. Quickly tip into a bowl to cool and stop cooking (discard the bits later). You can add this to so many dishes to give them a little kick. The Combi-Hob from the new Samsung infinite range is great for this, as it has two dual flex zones allowing you to heat multiple pans at different temperatures.","","Base and spice","More often than not, onions, leeks, scallions, shallots and garlic make the base of a recipe (if you have an allium allergy focus on spices and final seasoning). For browning onions, make sure they’re cut evenly, and have enough room in the pan. Add a good knob of butter and a splash of oil (so the butter doesn’t burn). Ensure you control the heat, start medium high and reduce slightly once they start to colour (around 8-12mins).  Mix now and again, adding the pan’s lid halfway through – the earlier you add the lid the softer the onions go. Leeks and spring onions are also great when softened as a base. Watch out for garlic – it can taste bitter if it gets burnt, so don’t add it in too early or on too high of a heat. Invest in a good, heavy non-stick pan and roasting tin, it will make browning bubbling and sizzling much more effective.","The next ingredients to get the single origin stamp are spices, just like everything else they come in grades of quality. Lightly toasting whole spices in a dry pan on a low heat for around a minute can really lift the flavour.  Ensure to cook the spices long enough so that they get the full taste – this is key in Indian cooking. ","","Smoked aubergine dip","Serves 4From start to serve 25 mins","- 2 large aubergines- 175g thick Greek yoghurt- ½ clove crushed garlic- A squeeze of lemon and a pinch of salt- 40g browned butter (or use 3tbsp of a good extra virgin olive oil if you prefer)","Hold the aubergines on a gas flame on the hob using flameproof tongs, (or put them under a high grill). Cook for 10-12 minutes, turning every 2-3 mins to char them evenly. Their skin will look blackened and blistered on the outside but inside should be soft and tender.","Once cool enough to handle, peel off the skin with your hands. Then mash the flesh with the garlic, lemon, yoghurt and salt.","For an Indonesian twist – swap half the yoghurt for coconut milk mixed with 3tbsp peanut butter. Add ¾tsp curry powder as you brown the butter, cool slightly then drizzle over the dip. Sprinkle chopped roasted peanuts, coconut flakes, sesame seeds, golden raisins, sultanas or chopped coriander over the top.","For a Greek twist – drizzle over tahini. Add a pinch of cumin seeds and chilli flakes. Once it’s almost ready, cool slightly then drizzle over the dip and sprinkle over chopped toasted walnuts, pine nuts, golden raisins or sultanas.","For a curveball try an Ethiopian twist - add ¼ -1tsp berbere spice blend, ½ tsp nigella seeds and 4 bashed cardamon pods as you brown the butter, cool slightly then drizzle over the dip. Sprinkle over chopped toasted hazelnuts, almonds, raisins, sultanas and a drizzle of honey.","Authentic ingredients to get an authentic taste","You can adapt your restaurant favourites to your home kitchen just with a little preplanning or tweaking to the tools you have. Pad Thai is a good one, at home it can be grey greens and sludgy noodles. Chefs always have the ingredients prepped and partially cooked before sizzling it all in one pan to serve. So, try cooking your elements separately if you haven’t got a big wok and good flame control underneath – don’t overcook, veggies are nice with some bite and leaves wilt enough with the pan off the heat (just ensure to keep stirring well). Rinse your soaked or cooked noodles under cold water and toss with a little oil until you’re ready to use. Get your meat or tofu and begin to golden.  Add the soy, tamarind, sesame oil, lime juice to the pan with the rest of the food. Try adding a drop of water to loosen all those lovely crispy bits and juices.","A fully cooked roasted chicken, seasoned with chopped red chilli, mushrooms and green vegtables on a black cooking tray.

With today’s tech, book worms can start a dial-in reading club, songbirds can enjoy a digital karaoke session, and friends can stay up to date with the lives of those they care about most with a few swipes, taps, and double taps. After all, it’s believed that shared positive experiences can boost feelings of joy.","That's why we’ve listed some fun ways for you to make the most of getting in touch with your nearest and dearest, as well as introduce that positive experience and source of joy to your life, and the lives of those you care about.","Words with friends","Start a club - Some of the grandest movements in history started with a few people gathering together and sharing their thoughts and values. Love reading, how about a book club? Movie buff? Then start a film debate society.","Set a time in the diary and decide a format. Will the chosen book or movie be selected by vote or a new member every week? If you’re starting the club for young kids - siblings, children, nieces or nephews, will the club involve reading the book out loud in every session? If it’s an adult’s club, will each session be all about picking the story apart? The choice really is yours, but whichever route you’ve gone down, you’ve turned a solitary practice into an enriching conversation - go you.","Routine check-ins: We all have that one friend you just can’t get enough of.  Why not pick a time and get a calendar event in the diary weekly or daily that’s dedicated to you catching up, even if it’s just a five-minute check-in?  Whether you’re looking for some conversation outside of conference calls or want a fitness buddy to help you meet your wellbeing goals, it can be as simple as a message every morning to share your mood as a score out of ten.","Sing for joy: Numerous studies, including one carried out by Oxford University, have found that singing as part of a choir can boost health, happiness and connect our bodies and minds. There are a few virtual choirs around, like The Sofa Singers, which you can sign up for. That said, if you have friends you know love to sing, setting one up is simple - all you need is a smartphone or computer and wired headphones, minimising delay so all participants are beautifully in sync.","Family","Special occasions: Nothing makes us feel loved like a reminder that we’re remembered - and it works both ways. Whether it’s a birthday, graduation, or an anniversary, they’re all great reasons to reach out to family members who you might not see that often in the flesh. A tip to keep on top of staying in touch - list out everyone you want to keep in contact with and give them a designated slot in your calendar, with a reminder. You can even pre-write the ‘thinking of you’ message into your calendar, so even if your busy when your phone buzzes to prompt you, sharing your love and thoughts can be as simple as a copy and paste.","Grandparents: There have never been more connected grandparents than there are now, but that doesn’t change the fact, elderly loneliness is getting a lot of folks over 70 down. Why? It’s harder for those who didn’t grow up with tech to set themselves up for video calling and instant messaging. If you know an elderly relative who isn’t living their best digital life just yet, dig out that old phone or tablet, sign them up for video calls,  and get them chatting to family around the world - trust us, you definitely can teach an old dog new tricks.","Family gatherings: Now you’ve connected your grandparents, everyone in your family is primed for a get-together. Popular video call platforms support in excess of 100 participants at a time, so what are you waiting for? Mark out group chat times every few weeks, keeping family of all ages in the conversation, open the calls with a lesson on mute etiquette to minimise on interference and background noise and get chatting as if you were all in the same room.","Significant others","Get creative: Who doesn’t love a good challenge? That’s why combining creative challenges with a romantic gesture is ideal, tapping into your competitiveness, sense of playfulness and romance all at the same time. What kinds of challenges? Here are a few examples:","- Make a token of affection that costs £15 or less and can fit through the letterbox- Write a poem that best describes your significant other in 60 words or less- Draw a digital sketch of your fondest memory together – the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 lite S Pen is great for those with hands that have a tendency to shake, as it has over 4,000 levels of pressure and sensitivity, helping to bring that special moment to life.- Create a new cocktail for one another, explaining why each ingredient was chosen. It will taste even better when they taste it in real time!","Save the shared experience of opening the present, reading the poem or sipping the cocktail until you’re both on a video call, and you can live the moment together, despite the distance. Why not snap and share on Instagram with #SamsungKX to inspire your friends to do similar challenges.","Unprompted tokens of affection: Online shopping is a fab tool for any couple intent on keeping romance alive across time zones.

Behind her a bedroom scene is visible with a light blue bed.","Staying in in style","It’s time to swap your sweatpants for something more stylish! Beauty journalist, Charlie Bell, shares a handy guide on mastering your indoor wardrobe.","Although it might be tempting to stay in your pyjamas when you have no plans to leave the house, our outfits can seriously impact our productivity so it’s a good idea to switch up your look for whatever your daily schedule throws at you. From chic activewear for those sitting-room squats, to comfortable yet professional work from home attire, give your wardrobe a chic upgrade with these savvy styling tricks.","Bedroom Bootcamp","Keeping fit without having to step foot in a gym has never been easier thanks to live streaming services and social media, and it feels even better in cute gym wear! It’s important however that you continue looking the part - as well as avoiding injury, working out in the right gear simply puts you in the right mindset and helps kick-start your new exercise regime. Whether it’s a sweaty HIIT sesh or a more chilled-out yoga lesson, make sure you go for breathable t-shirts, seamless styles and figure-sculpting leggings for maximum comfort and support. Bold prints and colour-popping hues will help get those endorphins flowing too. Marks & Spencer’s Good Move activewear range is functional and fashionable and super affordable too, catering for most workouts. Sweaty Betty Power Leggings (£75, sweatybetty.com) are also well worth the investment with their handy pockets and bum-sculpting fabrics. Stylish enough for those dress-down Sundays too.","Working Wardrobe","Working from home can often present a few challenges. The upside, your commute has been significantly reduced to the two minutes it takes you to get from your bed to your makeshift desk. But the downside, your motivation is also dwindling. Make sure you hit the ground running by showering and dressing as normal as it will help add structure to your day and keep you focused. Don’t worry about reaching for your usual office attire as comfort is key, so swap a suit for something low maintenance. An oversized shirt with jeans looks polished, yet casual. A tailored jumpsuit or a boyfriend tee and wide-leg trousers are relaxed enough to be worn all day (and still professional for any important video conference calls!). H&M have a gorgeous selection of fashion forward basics that you can weave into your current wardrobe. I also love a throw-on dress – one with no restricting waistband. Comfy and carefree, they look like you made the effort too.","Party Time","Whether you’re having a virtual dinner party with family or cocktails with friends, this is the perfect time to experiment with new styles. And don’t forget to snap your looks too and hashtag #SamsungKX! The Samsung Galaxy S20 has a wide-angle camera for horizontal pics, making it easier to show off those outfits on the ‘gram. The classic jeans and a nice top combo can really come into play whilst statement sleeves such as a puff or a balloon are having a fashion moment and are great for creating an impact. Try Zara for a chic and affordable selection. If not your style, then why not dig out your party season sequins and give them a bit more longevity? A sparkly top or jumper can easily be dressed down with denim or loungewear, putting you straight in the party mood. If you’d rather stick to your basics, give a plain tee or sweater a jazzy upgrade with a shoulder-grazing earring or a chunky necklace. And finish off with a swipe of red lippie to get the (virtual) party started.","By Charlie Bell.","Charlie is a London-based fashion, beauty and lifestyle editor with over twelve years' experience in the media industry.

Behind her a bedroom scene is visible with a light blue bed.","Smart ways to up your running game","There really isn’t a lot to running. If you’ve got suitable footwear and a willingness to put one foot in front of the other (at a slightly quicker than walking pace), then you’re making it happen.","What is often the most challenging aspect of running is to keep on doing it – whether that’s outside or jumping back on that treadmill. If you’re doing it for fitness reasons or because running simply helps to clear your mind, making it a regular habit is often the tough part.","There isn’t a single one answer to help make running a more permanent fixture in your life. We are all made differently. There are things though that people of all abilities can embrace to make the most of that time pounding the pavement or the running belt. Especially if you’re planning to take your smartwatch along with you.","Spend some time indoors","Some will always favour putting in some miles out in the fresh air, but there’s plenty of reasons to take your running inside too. It’s a good way to start shifting the focus on how you run. By thinking more about form and technique without the outside distractions, it can ultimately improve your running in general and can help reduce the risk of picking up injury niggles.","It’s also fine to use that time to work on your mental ability to stick it out for long periods. Distract yourself with something to watch or listen to, if that treadmill time feels mundane. Ultimately, your goal is to get more comfortable running for longer periods.","However you approach running indoors, have your watch on to track the action and calibrate it to ensure you’re getting the reliable data when you hit that stop button.","Focus on stats that matter most to you","When you think about the data being recorded as you run, it’s perfectly understandable to feel a bit overwhelmed by the numbers and information being dished out. You don’t need to pay attention to all of it. ","You don’t have to track your average pace, how many calories you’ve burned or even get to grips with what your running cadence is. Put the data that means most to you front and centre. ","Take the time to customise what your watch shows you, to minimise fiddling around before you run. Also to focus on the running part as opposed to what those stats say.","Challenge yourself and nobody else","Don’t get caught up in measuring yourself against others who might be running faster or further than you. It’s easy to do, but it’s important to set your own targets and then choose whether to shout about them or privately punch the air when you nail them.","That goal doesn’t have to be a race. Think of running for a certain amount of time or distance before you think about other challenges. ","It doesn’t matter how long or far those targets are. These goals can be simply set up from your watch, making it easier to see in real-time when you’ve achieved them. Start small and then build to bigger challenges, only when you’re ready to do so.","Don't just run","It might sound odd to tell you not to run, but it’s an important piece of advice as any here. You don’t need to run all the time. Especially if you’re getting into it for the first time. ","For starters, your body will need time to recover in between runs. While the pressure of seeing other people logging miles every day might play on your mind, stick to what works for you and feels right.","It’s also just as good to mix things up on the exercise front. Whether you throw yourself into the pool or get on your bike. You can even stay home, keep things simple and work on some strength building exercises that don't always require equipment. ","The Samsung Galaxy Watch is able to track multiple sports, so you can have that data to pore over just like your running stats.","Adding in these other physical activities can have a positive impact on your running by helping to make the prospect of doing it less of a chore because it’s not the only thing you’re doing.","Try to stick to a schedule","This feeds into the above. It’s good to get a bit of a routine going and come to agreement with yourself on how much you can or want to do. ","Get it plotted into your calendar, so you can do something to stick to long-term. If you miss a run, and no doubt it’ll happen from time to time, set a reminder to make up for it by scheduling another. ","This isn’t about putting pressure on yourself to run, but just making yourself more accountable and by building a routine, you can also better gauge progress.","By Mike Sawh","Mike Sawh is a freelance journalist covering wearable tech and fitness for the likes of GQ, Wired and Wareable.

","With there never being a better time to focus on self-care, here she gives an overview of what mindfulness is and how we can all begin to practice it.","","What is mindfulness?","Mindfulness is a way of training our attention to be in the present. This may sound simple, but it means being with whatever is occurring, pleasant or unpleasant, and that can be challenging.","It’s about accepting the thoughts, feelings and sensations we experience, with an attitude of kindness, patience and self-compassion. It’s not about pushing those thoughts away; a common misconception.","Why is mindfulness important?","Mindfulness has proven to help a range of issues, from managing stress and anxiety to preventing depression and improving concentration.","One piece of research by Killingsworth and Gilbert (2010), which focused on smartphone app behaviours, found that those whose minds tended to wander were typically less happy than those that focused on the present.","Mindfulness enables us to train our minds to be in the moment, enriching and enhancing our experience. Ultimately, it allows us to make the most of the wonderful moments of our lives, without being lost in thoughts about the past or future.","","What is mindful breathing and how do I practice it?","Mindful breathing is a basic but powerful meditation practice. The idea is simply to focus your attention on the natural rhythm and flow of your breath, feeling each inhale and exhale, however many times you need to. This is a good technique for helping to manage chronic pain and especially useful when faced with a stressful situation. If for example you are working from home and suddenly become overwhelmed by your to-do list, go to a different room, stand still and take a few deep breaths. This will lower the heart rate and bring you back to a state of calm, ready to focus on the tasks at hand.","One easy way of practicing mindful breathing, even when on the go, is to download the Samsung Health app onto your smartphone. You can access a range of short breathing exercises via the “Mindfulness” icon. My favourite is the one-minute session which is simply six inhale and exhales which it counts with you, helping to give instant relief to the whatever tensions you are feeling.","","What other practises are available to me?","Formal meditation practice – Using meditation to dedicate our time to the senses and focussing on the present moment. We can use sounds, the body, the breath and so on to anchor our attention.","When we start trying to do this, we will quickly notice it’s not easy, and the mind will wander into daydreams, worries and judgements. The wandering mind isn’t a problem, it’s part of the practice. The aim is to notice when it happens and guide the mind back. Every time we return back, we are strengthening this “muscle” of attention.","Informal mindfulness practice - Bringing a mindful awareness to day-to-day activities. This could be anything from brushing your teeth, to eating a meal or walking down the street.","All you need to do is to try and pay attention to whatever it is you’re doing and the sensations you are feeling such as taste, movement and touch. Be curious about what you notice when doing everyday activities. As with the formal practice, when the mind wanders off, simply bring it back to whatever you’re doing. What could you bring mindful attention to today?","","To have a go at a guided mindfulness practice or breathing exercise, download the Samsung Health app or visit The Mindfulness Project on YouTube.","If you or a family member is interested in joining Samsung’s community partner programmes, please visit their websites here: Age UK Camden and Mind in Camden.","Articles"],"meta":{"icon":"article","tags":[]}},{"id":"lifestyle|michel-roux-jnr","title":"Behind the Scenes with Michel Roux Jnr: Four ways to upgrade your cooking ","description":"","image":"https://images.samsung.com/is/image/samsung/assets/uk/explore/kings-cross/home-of-innovation/lifestyle/michel-roux-jnr/thumb.jpg","category":"lifestyle","url":"/uk/explore/kings-cross/lifestyle/michel-roux-jnr","values":["Behind the Scenes with Michel Roux Jnr: Four ways to upgrade your cooking ","","","","Behind the Scenes with Michel Roux Jnr:","Four ways to upgrade your cooking","Samsung KX invites renowned international chef Michel Roux Jr to share his favourite recipes in the Samsung KX Connected Kitchen, where he teaches how to elevate your dishes with the Samsung Infinite Line cooking range.","The Samsung KX Connected Kitchen houses the unique Infinite Line range, which promises to make entertaining a lot less daunting when it comes to making show-stopping recipes.

Try to avoid spaces within the home associated with leisure and relaxation such as the bedroom or in front of a TV and keep them strictly for enjoying during out-of-office hours. ","A woman in a stripey top working from home, writing using pen and paper, and sitting at a desk.","2) Declutter the desk","Try to tidy the desk at the end of the day, so you can start with a clear surface the next morning. The Samsung Space Monitor is a great way of maximising this space as it pushes back to sit flat against a wall, leaving the entire work surface clear so you can focus on what’s on the screen, and not what’s surrounding it .","A well set up desk looks neat and tidy, with a computer monitor, pen and paper, candles and plants, plus white office chair","3) A workspace with a view ","Natural light produces Vitamin D , which is believed to improve motivation and efficiency through its ability to increase endorphins and serotonin levels . Home workspaces should ideally be located near a window so you can directly benefit from the sun’s rays.","4) Stick to the schedule ","Working at home is a challenge. You either have a million things to do at once or you get into a good rhythm and then time runs away with you, it’s all too easy to forget the important things. Taking time out is vital for your mental health so make sure you plan plenty of breaks. Ensure you have fixed time slots in place that are exclusively for exercise or spending time with loved ones.","5) Bring the outside in","Those working from home should design their space with things that motivate them and have a positive influence such as pictures of loved ones or pets . Indoor plants not only brighten desks but can also act as air purifiers through absorbing dust and helping to remove harmful chemicals. Aloe Vera plants are ideal for this and a desk-size won’t require much maintenance .","A woman tends to a large indoor plant.

In fact, reading has been proven to reduce stress levels by 68%*, which is more effective than listening to music or taking a walk. Head over to our recent ‘Guest writer of the week’ article, ‘Shared experiences boost happiness’ for tips on starting a book club and turning a solitary activity into a fun evening with friends. ","2) Writing workouts","Aspiring writers should spend up to 10 minutes a day expressing a flow of current thoughts onto paper – this narrative style is known as a ‘stream-of-consciousness’ and helps transfer feelings to words, which can often be one of the big challenges when it comes to authoring. This can be done using a spare notepad, or tools such as the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 thanks to its handy S Pen, perfect for those who prefer to go digital.","A flat lay image of a white desk from above is pictured.

Epigrams are funny and witty, lyrics are emotional and personal, limericks rhyme and Haikus bend syllables for effect – pick a genre and begin playing with words.","5) Video tutorials","From guidance across the different genres, to conquering writer’s block – there’s dozens of free, expert tutorials online to improve literacy skills. Writing enthusiasts should try to devote an hour each week to an online course and watch the confidence inside build.","*The Monday Campaigns, Reading Fiction for Stress Relief, March 2020","A flat lay image of a white desk from above is pictured.

This will open the mind and gives you a chance to take in the surroundings and help clear your head of any stress or worries. ","2) Engage the senses","When consuming meals on the go, it’s a common habit to not pay attention to what we are eating. When it comes to enjoying food, everyone should take a moment to engage in all five senses as this will unlock deeper appreciation for food and allow you to listen to your body’s signals, such as satisfaction and fullness.","Woman sitting down at table, slicing banana over a bowl of cerel","3) Get creative with colours","Mindfulness colouring books are a playful way to engage the mind whilst reducing stress.

Try to avoid caffeine in the evenings and resist daytime naps, instead build an internal body clock through a set bedtime routine and wake up alarm. If struggling to fall asleep, try a meditation and relaxation aid through the Samsung Health app which updates on a weekly basis with new ‘sleep stories’ to drift off to.","Woman lying fast alseep in a bed with white bedding","5) Stream away stress","Experiencing new sounds can also help uncover a refreshing state of mindfulness.

If not, this can be counteractive as the player can end up mindlessly trudging through and not taking time to relish success, such as hitting advanced levels or upgrading character stats. Prolonged sessions can also cause the feeling of monotony and exhaustion. ","2) Switch it up","Players shouldn’t binge on the same game all day. Focusing on one game over and over in succession will likely deplete the continued enjoyment of it. Gaming is a great way to relax, so keep a broad selection available for maximum benefit."," A young man and woman sit on a blue sofa holding gaming controller within a dimly lit modern living room playing on a video game. Their faces are lit up by the blue lights from the game.","3) Keep it social","Players should connect and compete with friends over the internet. When consoles aren’t compatible, friends can video call one another and play as if they are hanging out in the same house. Better yet, they can take it a step further by livestreaming together - there’s never been a better time to become a gaming streamer and share your skills with others.","4) Ban the PJs","Players should always get dressed and keep to regular meals (or at least have a few healthy snacks nearby). Spending all day in pyjamas can have a negative effect on the brain, giving the feeling that the day has been wasted when you’ve in fact, conquered a whole new world.

Given the right conditions, sunflowers progress nicely both indoors and out, and a fun one for kids to watch them grow. Alternatively, freshly scented geraniums make for pretty hanging baskets or cane begonias will add beautiful foliage to any surface.","2) Snapping smartphone photography","Spruce up your photography skills using just a smartphone. Online tutorials are a great place to start for creative ideas such as learning how to capture stunning sunsets with tech influencer, GadgetsBoy. Those experimenting in the kitchen can have a go at styling and snapping dishes with a neutral backdrop (dining tables or kitchen worktops will suffice!), and simple dressing props, such as fresh herbs or flowers for a pop of colour.","Grey cat with pink collar lies down on its back on stone floor outside","3) Putting pen to paint","Craving to get out the paints but put off by the mess? The Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 is perfect for digitally experimenting with different hues. Whether it’s family portraits or a picturesque nature spot discovered on a walk, both beginner and experienced artists can explore a range of design and sketching tools to develop their latest creations.","Two hands hold a Samsung tablet, using an S Pen in the right hand to draw a cartoon of a small boy's head using a drawing app. In the background, there is blurred out green pages and walkways.","4) Framing the favourites","A great amount of time is spent snapping precious moments and smartphones are perfect for storing them, though why not print a selection of personal favourites to create the ultimate memory album. Once complete, sit back, relax and relive the good times or even better, set up a video call to laugh over the different shots shared. These books can be safely stored away and admired again in years to come or even kept on the coffee table for all to enjoy.","5) Sending love","Make a friend or family member’s day with a personalised self-care package. From homemade arts and crafts like a portrait or card, to freshly baked biscuits or a new book by their favourite author, simply fill an empty box with items that are special to them and leave as a surprise on their doorstep to show you’re thinking of them.","Grey cat with pink collar lies down on its back on stone floor outside","Two hands hold a Samsung tablet, using an S Pen in the right hand to draw a cartoon of a small boy's head using a drawing app. In the background, there is blurred out green pages and walkways.

The Samsung Frame TV is great for those struggling to choose suitable artwork – users can simply scroll through the Art Store and virtually explore galleries from around the world. The picture will also automatically adjust to match the room’s light, ensuring the colour tone perfectly matches those of a traditional art piece.","Photo of a traditional painting depicting a medieval town under seige from an advancing army of foot soliders and horses lead by King Henry VIII","2) Bohemian vibe","Try earthy coloured throws, patchwork cushions and crochet chairs for a Boho look and feel. Soft woven wall art is also great – it instantly gives rooms a relaxing, Californian feel. There’s plenty online to choose from, or if feeling creative, take it on as a new DIY project in seven simple steps.","3) Minimal décor","Minimalist interiors can often feel tricky to achieve but they don’t have to be – use clean lines, practical furniture and a simple palette as a framework for nailing this sleek style. Adding a spot of green foliage also helps to give character without the clutter; for smaller rooms, try Ceropegia Woodii plants – they’re perfectly sized for using within indoor hanging baskets – whereas Dragon Trees look great in larger rooms. ","4) Shabby chic","Upcycling furniture is key for going shabby chic.  Look online for antique items that can be transformed - think wooden ladders for bookshelves, or rustic plant pots for candle holders. Spend the afternoon coating with off-white paint and remember to finish with a layer of wax for protection.","5) Pastel prettiness","Pastels are brilliant for brightening up the home, trying adding a sense of serenity with art or giving the walls a 360 ‘paintover’. In need of inspo? Take a read of Amy Moorea Wong’s article - 'ways to decorate with playful pastels'.","Photo of a tall living room with traditional ceiling trim is pictured with a retro white and black fireplace on a moss green painted wall and a pastal pink painted alcove to the right of the fireplace.
